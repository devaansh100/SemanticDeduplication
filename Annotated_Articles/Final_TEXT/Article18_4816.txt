A second-year master\'s hostel student requesting anonymity told TNIE, "We have been repeatedly expressing that the food has not been cooked well in the kitchen and many had food poisoning and vomiting reported before. The hostel cafeteria and kitchen are also not hygienic environments. We have been complaining to the kitchen staff and also concerned authorities but no action has been taken. Today, with a lizard found in the food, many have consumed it before it was reported. The water has also been causing skin allergies in the students staying in the hostel. We request for an inspection to be conducted for a hygiene environment."
