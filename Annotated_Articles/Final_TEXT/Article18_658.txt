Efforts are on to preserve the leopard’s pug mark and other evidence by planning a campaign. The forest department has placed a new cage in Sudeenpurwa village. Two cocks have been placed as bait to bring the leopard to the cage. Two night vision cameras have been installed to capture the movement of the leopard at night,” said district forest officer Arvind Yadav and added, “Though the leopard did not show up in the past couple of days, we are expecting that it will come soon near the newly placed bait.”After locals had approached the forest department following sighting of big cat’s pugmarks the latter installed four night vision cameras. Forest department had placed a cage with dead cattle as bait but they are yet to nab the leopard. They had earlier issued an advisory in the interest of residents that they should take precautions and venture in groups and not alone in the open.Though the leopard had killed a few animals including a wild boar over the past few days, it has not attacked any human beings so far. Forest officials said the forest cover in the Katri, which is spread over a vast area, is an ideal habitat for a leopard due to easy availability of prey.']
