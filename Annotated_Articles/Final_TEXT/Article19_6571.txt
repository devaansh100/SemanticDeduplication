Mrs. Packletide, alongwith a paid companion, Miss Mebbin, crouched on a platform constructed specially for this on a tree. A goat was fastened as a bait for the tiger and everyone started waiting for the tiger. They had to wait for sometime and then they heard the footsteps of the tiger. Mrs. Packletide shot using her rifle and the tiger was dead. Everyone rejoiced over the killing, when they came down from the tree.

As one of the villagers participating in the hunting expedition, you are surprised to see an extravagant display of wealth and money for fame which ends in failure. You decide to write a diary mocking at the situation and expressing your feelings against the show of false ego. Ans. Saturday 9 February 2014 10 p.m. Dear Diary I had an enjoyable day today as I participated in Mrs. Packletide’s hunting expedition. I was very happy to get a large sum of money which would make many of my dreams come true. Mrs. Packletide paid a lot of money to all of us just for her false ego. She just wanted to show off that she was better than her friend Miss Loona Bimberton but all this was wrong. Just to satisfy her ego she had killed a tiger and distributed money among villagers for making her efforts a success. I wish she had spent this money on feeding some poor children or she had gone to some orphanage to help those poor children. It is strange that there are some people who don’t have food to eat and there are others who throw money just to flaunt. This extravagant display of wealth and money for some is rather disgusting. The money should have been spent for a noble cause. Louis Important Questions for Class 10 English Literature Chapter 2 Mrs. Packletide’s Tiger will help you.
