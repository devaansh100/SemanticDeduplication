['5 held in M’hanj for jumbo tusk smuggling\nBaripada Forest Division officials have arrested five persons on the charge of smuggling two elephant tusks near Titia Chhak under the forest division in Mayurbhanj district. An official said that one of the tusks measured 45-cm-long and weighed 700 gram while the other one was 38-cm-long and weighed 600 gram. The tusks had been removed from an eight-nine-year-old baby elephant. The tusks, estimated to cost around Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000 each, were being smuggled to West Bengal, the official said. The accused were Debendranath Mahali, Jagannath Sigh, Pankaj Kumar Mahali, Binu Singh from Uparataladiha village and Sushant Singh of Jamudiha village under the Udala police station. Honorary Wildlife Warden Bhanumitra Acharya said the seized tusks date back to one to two years. “As a tusker carcass has not been seized in past one or two years, it is suspected that poachers might have killed the elephant in the Similipal core area or hid its carcass somewhere to extract the tusks,” he added.']
