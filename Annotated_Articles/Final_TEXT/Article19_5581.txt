['Opinion| Owls cry foul\nThe Uttar Pradesh police rescued five rare owls that were about to be delivered to an occultist in Ghaziabad, adjoining Delhi, earlier this week. The cops nabbed two smugglers who were carrying the five, worth an estimated ₹1 crore, in a bucket. A brutal fate awaited these majestic birds. They were meant to be sacrificed on Diwali night. Demand for these birds for this purpose, it turns out, tends to spike just ahead of the festival of lights. India is home to 30 species of owls, all protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Numerous omens and myths are associated with owls. They are seen to bring luck and wisdom, while their screech is considered an omen of death. In Hindu mythology, an owl is the vehicle of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. People worship Lakshmi on Diwali, while exorcists sacrifice the bird in black-magic rituals that are believed to dispel bad luck and bring prosperity. Reportedly, every body part of the bird holds some significance in sorcery. An owl could be entombed alive outside the door of a house for Diwali, or blinded and tortured over several days. There is no evidence that anyone has ever got richer or had an upturn in other fortunes. Yet, such superstitions persist. Could the economic slump be turning people to these ghastly practices? Or does it simply to poor educational standards in the country? Whatever the forces acting against these hapless birds, the country needs a campaign to keep them safe from occultists. Perhaps the central bank’s former governor Raghuram Rajan could be drafted for this cause. Asked once whether he was a hawk or dove on inflation, he’d said he was an owl. Topics']
