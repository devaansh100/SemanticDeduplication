According to police, passengers crossing platform No. 3 of the Sanitorium station, noticed a two-feet-long snake coiled around a stone bench. It was assumed to be a baby python. Passengers and passersby alerted railway officials and the local police who informed the forest department in Tambaram. After 30 minutes, the reptile was rescued and sent to the forest office in Velachery. Sources said, “In the absence of a foot-overbridge between the platforms, passengers were forced to cross the railway lines to reach the other side.” Passengers accused the railway officials of not clearing bushes near the station and platforms. Passengers using platform-3 had often faced threat of poisonous snakes and other reptiles, as it is always covered by bushes. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, Mohan, forest Ranger, TN forest department, Velachery, said the snake was a common sand boa, and not a python as it was made out to be. The reptile would be kept under watch for 15 days, he added.']
