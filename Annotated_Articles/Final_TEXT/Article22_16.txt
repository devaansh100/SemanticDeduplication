['Video of migrating otter family sticking around for last pup to catch up goes viral\nThe entire family waited until they could finally catch a hold of the last pup in its 10th attempt KEY HIGHLIGHTS A viral video shows a family of 6 otters trying to climb a wall. Three young pups found themselves left behind but the family managed to grab a hold of two. But the entire romp of otters stuck around for the last one until it could catch up after 10 whole attempts. Unless one is inherently a solitary animal or of the lone wolf sort, all creatures including humans need families. A video doing rounds on the internet shows a romp of six otters trying to climb a wall as three younger ones find the wall too high. While one grab of the jaw is enough to lift two otters, a third one struggles to time its jump several times. The entire family sticks around and finally, in its 10th attempt, the young otter is caught mid-air by a family member. IAS officer Awanish Sharan shared the clip on Twitter. "‘परिवार’ इसलिए भी ज़रूरी है," he wrote. After the younger one caught up, the family got going again. Maybe, they were trying to get to the otter side.']
