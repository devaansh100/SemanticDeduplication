Zuzu was distracted away from the child before the zoo management could run to her rescue. Footage that has been widely shared online shows six zookeepers entering the enclosure and one of them picking the girl up and carrying her away. According to Daily Mail, the unmarried mother was detained and charged with an attempt to murder and may face 15 years in jail if convicted. A spokesperson for the zoo said, “A young woman threw a little girl down into a brown bear’s enclosure, in front of all the visitors,”. “It was completely unclear what her motive was. Both the visitors and the staff of the zoo were trying to stop her – but failed,” the spokesperson added. The girl is currently stable and is undergoing treatment at the hospital.']
