After the teenagers injured a heron, the actor stopped his car and video-recorded the incident, while asking the youngsters why they had harmed the bird.“The boys ran down the flyover with the injured bird. The boy carrying the bird gave me a flimsy excuse that it was to make ‘medicine’ for an ailing family member. I have brought this to the attention of Mumbai Police as it is dangerous for anyone to be standing on this bridge, leave alone killing birds ,”' Shinde told TOI. He added, “The injured bird was struggling to free itself from the boy’s hands. The scene was upsetting.”'Animal activist Sneha Visaria of Just Smile Charitable Trust said, “After this flyover opened last year, coastal water birds like herons and egrets tend to fly a few feet above. So, some miscreants have got this evil idea to poach the birds by standing on this flyover. Hope the authorities take action.”Wildlife activist of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare Pawan Sharma said he will inform forest officials."]
