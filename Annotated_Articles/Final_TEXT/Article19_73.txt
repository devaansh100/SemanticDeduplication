The sambhar showed up on the busy market streets of Sector22 and made an attempt to hide between cars parked behind the showrooms. The wild creature tried to hide from the spectators and tried to find his way out. The animal rescue team, however, went to the area but was underarmed as it carried just a yellow net and no tranquilisers.

After multiple attempts of the rescue team to calm him, the sambhar eventually stepped into the net. According to the Forest and Wildlife Authorities, the animal will be released into the forest behind the Sukhna Lake. The residents, though amused, stated that a sight like this was not completely new for them. They recalled an incident from last year when a stag visited Sector 23 of the city. The constant visits of the sambhars are being attributed to the proximity between the sector to Leisure Valley and since it is situated behind the Sukhna Lake, the sambhars lose track of their way and end up in the busy streets of the city. A similar yet more dangerous incident was recently reported from Jalandhar when a leopard strayed into Lamma Pind of Jalandhar and gave the rescue team a hard time in catching it."]
