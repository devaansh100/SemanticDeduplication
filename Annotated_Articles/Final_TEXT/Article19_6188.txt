There are four types of poisonous snakes in India of which cobra and common Krait are most commonly found to invade residential areas. In case of a snake bite, doctors advise people to never panic.“Panicking will only lead to death for sure. Remember, not all snake bites are poisonous. Anti-snake venom is also available. The first thing to do is to immobilize the bitten area and take the person to the nearest hospital,” said Dr R Ramesh, consultant physician at Velammal Medical College Hospital.It has also been advised against tying tourniquets by medically untrained people. “There is this myth that first aid for snake bites is cutting open the wound and sucking the blood. This only agitates absorption of the poison. Even tourniquets tied too tightly can result in gangrenes from poor blood supply and subsequently amputation would be the only option,” said Dr Ramesh.While anti-snake venom is considerably safe and can treat poison from all four types of poisonous snakes, Dr Ramesh noted that some people might get severe allergic reaction. In such cases, patients need to be monitored very closely and given anti-snake venom at the right time. The physician also warned about people unconsciously neglecting snake bites. “I have seen patients wake up early morning suffering from paralysis in one of their limbs. Common Kraits tend to invade houses at night and bite, leaving behind no fang marks. The symptoms manifest only hours later,” he said.']
