The death dance on this section continues regularly, but neither the SECR, nor the state forest department is strongly pursuing the matter with the Railway Board on mitigation steps.The number of such wildlife deaths is frightening. As per information sought under the RTI Act by green activist Shrikant Deshpande, the Nagpur division of SECR has admitted that 130 wild animals including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, gaurs, wild dogs, nilgais, deer, wild boars have been killed from 2001 till October 2021.Deshpande says, “The figure is just the tip of the iceberg as many deaths of birds, reptiles, and other small mammals go unrecorded. Besides, there is distortion in figures given by the SECR as the number doesn’t include three sloth bears (mother & cubs) that were run over near Kelzar on July 13, 2017.”“The SECR has also not given the break-up of the 130 deaths, though it claimed that from 2016 till September 2021 (4 years and 9 months) 49 wild animals, including five tigers, died in train accidents. It also doesn’t make mention of a one-year-old tiger’s death on March 8, 2021. There is a mismatch and the number of deaths may well be beyond 500,” he said.Deshpande adds, “While the SECR at least supplied RTI information, the forest department is still sitting over my application submitted in November 2021, indicating how serious it is on the issue. Only high court intervention can salvage the situation now.”Kishor Rithe, a state wildlife board member who is also on the SWBL sub-committee of experts and user agencies implementing linear projects, said, “The committee in its meetings always insisted on the SECR to restrict speed in forested patches, but the zone has failed to implement it. We had asked the SECR representative to inform the Railway Board about the committee decision, but to no avail.”Deshpande says, “The railways is at fault. As per the RTI reply, the average speed of the trains is still @66.5kmph and apart from goods trains, at least four pairs (eight trains) operate on this route. Of the 250km route, 75km passes through dense forest patches between Nagbhid-Chanda Fort and 15km between Gondia-Nagbhid. Most of the tracks through the forest fall in the eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR), hence mitigation steps are a must.”“After the death of 3 tiger cubs on November 15, 2018, in Junona area by a speeding train, then Chandrapur chief conservator of forests (CCF) SV Ramarao had ordered survey on mitigation steps to be suggested to SECR and accordingly has recommended a five-pronged strategy,” says state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre.“We identified at least 19 railway poles where trains should run with caution of 40kmph. Ramarao had suggested new underpasses in the most vulnerable forested ranges of Mamla, Junona, Sindewahi, Chichpalli, Talodhi, Balapur, and Nagbhid ranges in Bramhapuri and Chandrapur divisions. However, none of the measures are being followed by the SECR,” Dhotre added.Senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM) Vikas Kumar Kashyap said, “Any mitigation measures will have to come through the Railway Board. The Gondia-Wadsa section was opened in 1994, while Nagbhid-Chanda Fort-Ballarshah sections were commissioned in 1999, when there was no awareness and talk about mitigation measures. The new sections like Gondia-Jabalpur or Nagpur-Nagbhid are being elevated now.”“We have instructed loco pilots to blow whistles or flash lights or slow down the train if they see wild animals crossing the tracks,” said Kashyap.“In the years to come, frequency of trains will increase and there are plans to double the line on the said route which will prove disastrous. This will apparently affect more animals. It is a double whammy for wildlife as animals have been already hit by unnecessary road widening in TATR and NNTR corridor,” says Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society.WHAT CAN BE DONE* Facilitating ‘e-surveillance’ of tiger movement using 24x7, intelligent, thermal cameras at sensitive points, especially near railway tracks* Organizing tiger/wildlife sensitization workshops by NTCA for railway personnel, while providing information brochures in English and local language in tiger zones* Identification of sensitive habitats in Gondia-Chandrapur railway sector, based on ongoing Phase-IV monitoring using camera traps and other methods* Putting in place system for sharing of tiger spatial use data in advance between forest department and railways through VHF wireless on a day-to-day basis, with monthly joint review by senior railway and forest officials']
