['Sloth bear sighted near Hudkeshwar\nNagpur: Panic gripped Hudkeshwar (Khurd) village on the outskirts of Nagpur when residents sighted a sloth bear on Thursday night.The sparsely populated residential colony woke up to continuous barking of street dogs near Swaraj Nagar on NH-7. One of the residents, Rahul Rautwar, got suspicious and tried to find out in the torchlight what had happened. He was surprised to sight a sloth bear moving in the bushes.Rautwar immediately intimated members of the wildlife welfare centre (WWC) and people for animals (PFA) who reached the spot and also informed the forest department.“Our rescue team reached the spot on learning about the incident but the sloth bear was nowhere to be seen. It may have strayed from the nearby forests and retreated in the dark. We are monitoring the situation,” said Seminary Hills RFO Sarika Admane.“On the other side of Hudkeshwar (Khurd) village is NH7 and the forest area of Matkazari, Kaldongri, Banwadi, Zari, Wadad, Junapani of Umred and Butibori ranges are not far from the spot. The possibility of the bear entering the city outskirts from these forest areas cannot be ruled out,” said Swapnil Bodhane of PFA and WCC’s Nitish Bhandakkar.']
