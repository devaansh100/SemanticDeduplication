['Poaching racket busted in South Delhi\nThe Delhi Police, along with People For Animals (PFA) have busted a racket of poachers at a farmhouse in South Delhi\'s Kapashera area. According to police, the arrests in this regard were made on Tuesday. Police have seized skulls, skins and a body of several endangered species, all kept in the farmhouse. "The seized parts of the endangered species include two skulls of Bengal White Tiger and a leopard. The skin of a tiger and a leopard was also found with the heads missing. A stuffed body of a leopard was also found from the farmhouse," said Saurabh Gupta, PFA officer. Along with this, elephant teeth, two teeth of other species (yet to be identified), two sea corals and an endangered turtle were also recovered. "We got a tip-off that smuggling of endangered species will be carried out from a farmhouse. We sent a decoy customer to buy the tiger skin and when the deal was finalised, in a joint operation with the PFA, the Delhi Police conducted a raid," Gupta said. According to PFA officials, the tiger\'s nails were missing, along with the nails of that of the leopard. Each nail costs around Rs 5 to 7 lakh. During the investigation, it was found that the turtle and the sea corals come under the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. "There is a possibility that the skulls, organs, and bones of the tiger and leopard, whose skin was seized, had been sold earlier. Similarly, the remaining parts of the skulls could have been sold to other clients as well," an officer said.']
