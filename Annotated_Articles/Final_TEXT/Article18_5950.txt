['Dog vs leopard: Video of a canine scaring away a big cat goes viral\nIt goes without saying that between a dog and a leopard, the big cat is the more powerful animal on any given day. However, a video showing a shocking confrontation between the two animals proves this wrong. In the video doing rounds on social media, a dog can be seen lying on a road when a leopard tries to attack it. However, the dog holds its ground by incessantly barking at the leopard. The animals lock eyes with each other and the standoff ends with the leopard going back to the wilderness, leaving the dog unharmed.

Many people have praised the dog for its “confidence” and “bravery” under adverse circumstances. Interestingly, some people also pointed out that the leopard might have abandoned the dog because of the presence of humans. “If that leopard had been hungry it would have been MORE aggressive than this,” a Twitter user commented. While another noted that the dog’s presence in a forested area is odd. “What lack of lacunae! The debate here needs to be the presence of the dog in the forested area. Not ought to encourage it through sharing these videos as some sort of motivation,” the user noted.
