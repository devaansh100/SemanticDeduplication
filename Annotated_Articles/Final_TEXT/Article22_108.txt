They also seized a tractor load of timber, he added.The seizure of wildlife parts, officials said, was the first of its kind in Ganjam district in recent years. “It seems to be an organized network and the smuggling angle can’t be ruled out,” said an official. We suspect he might have kept the different animal organs for the purpose of trading, he added.Interrogation is going on of the accused to find out if any other persons were involved in the incident. “We have been watching his behaviour and movements for the past few some months,” Mishra said.
