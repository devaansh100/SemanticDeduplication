Many bird species such as herons used to take shelter on this grand old tree."It is very sad and tragic that such a big and beautiful peepal tree has been cut in Uran city. There is also a park next to the tree, and so citizens could enjoy the birds chirping on this lovely tree. What was the need to chop down this tree so badly? Was any tree officer or horticulturist consulted on how to safely prune the tree branches if that was required?\'\' said NatConnect Foundation director B N Kumar.The spot where the peepal tree stood is also very close to the office and barracks of Uran police station."I feel that this peepal tree has been eliminated because the official staff cars parked underneath may be getting spoilt by the bird droppings. This is a green tragedy, though,\'\' said environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti NGO The activists have also written to the Raigad district collector about this unfortunate tree cutting and demanded an inquiry into this incident.When TOI contacted the Uran tehsildar, Bhausaheb Andhare, he said: "The branches of the peepal tree had become very big and unbalanced; and so this tree could have fallen down, leading to serious damage and injuries. The Uran Municipal Council has cut the tree."']
