According to reports the bird had been taught to alert criminals to police operations in Vila Irmã Dulce, a low-income community in the sun-scorched capital of Piauí state by shouting: “Mum, the police!” \ufeff The parrot, who has not been named was seized as officers approached a house in northern Brazil. The officer said, “He must have been trained for this. As soon as the police got close he started shouting.” One of the Brazilian journalist described that the parrot is a “super obedient” creature, one that had kept its beak firmly shut after being “arrested”. “So far it hasn’t made a sound … completely silent,” the reporter said. “Lots of police officers have come by and he’s said nothing,”a local vet confirmed the parrot had not cooperated. The drug trafficking parrot has been handed over to the local zoo where it would spend three months learning to fly before being released. This bird has been added in the list of animals implicated in Brazil’s drug trade. In a raid in 2008 the police seized two alligators in western Rio de Janeiro, claiming local gangsters had fed their enemies to the animals. The father of one of the accused gangsters rejected those accusations, alleging his son’s gang had once tried to do so – but the alligator had refused to eat the corpse. You might like these']
