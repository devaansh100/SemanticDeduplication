Barely three weeks ago, an adult red kangaroo had been rescued from Kumargram near Buxa on the Bengal-Assam border. The animals, native to Australia , are not found in the wild in India.A forest department patrol party and passers-by first spotted two kangaroos hopping along the busy Gajoldoba Canal Road on Friday evening.

Around 8.30pm, a patrol team near Gajoldoba Canal Road found the kangaroos. They were rescued and brought to Belakoba range office,” said ranger Sanjay Dutta On Saturday morning, residents of Nepali bustee spotted a dead kangaroo. “It is suspected the animal was killed by a dog or jackal,” said a forester.']
