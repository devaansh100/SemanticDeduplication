He also took a dig at the old technique of rescuing the leopard and called it the “Mohenjo Daro Harappan technology”. “Another day. Another rescue of a leopard from open well using the Mohenjo Daro Harappan technology. This will stop only when we close the open wells around animal habitat,” said Nanda in the caption of the clip.

Forest department officials earned plaudits online for the rescue. Some users also urged covering open wells and avoiding risk for children and wildlife. “The leopard seems to be grateful and went off without harming anyone. Hats off to the forest department,” a user commented. Another user wrote, “This should be taken as a mission mode project, identification, GPS tagging of open wells and covering them from top with Mild Steel screen or checkerboard local made jali by welding thick MS rods. This will save lot of hassle.” This should be taken as a mission mode project, identification, GPS tagging of open wells and covering them from top with Mild Steel screen or checkerboard local made jali by welding thick MS rods.
