The animals were discovered when Nithya Raja (38) and Zakia Sulthana\'s (24) luggage was X-rayed. They were going to Chennai. Sathon Konggoen, chief of the airport\'s wildlife inspection office, told AFP: "This kind of case has happened many times because the animals have expensive price tags in India." "Animal trafficking is usually detected at the Thai-Myanmar borders and domestic airports to a certain extent." Officers found two armadillos, two porcupines, 20 snakes, 35 turtles and 50 chameleons in the bags. According to a Facebook post by the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, two dead iguanas were also found. The women have been charged with violating the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act, the Animal Epidemics Act and the Customs Act.']
