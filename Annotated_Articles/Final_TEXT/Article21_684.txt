['Man caught with Rs 13-cr cobra venom meant for China\nJalpaiguri: A man was on Friday arrested with cobra venom worth Rs 13 crore after he entered India from Bangladesh through the Hili border in South Dinajpur.Salim Akhtar, from South Dinajpur, reportedly admitted the consignment was headed to China from Bangladesh via India and Nepal. The consigment was seized at 73 More, on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri town. Forest officials pleaded for Akhtar’s remand for 14 days, but the court granted six days.The officials, acting on a tip-off, managed to arrest Akhtar but those who were to receive the venom escaped. Red dragon stickers on the venom containers raised officials’ suspicion that these were meant for China.Bengal forest minister Jyotipriya Mullick expressed similar suspicion and said several people, including a schoolteacher, had been arrested earlier too while smuggling snake venom.Previous instances had alerted forest officials to the presence of a number of gangs that were using Jalpaiguri to smuggle out venom to neighbouring countries, particularly China.']
