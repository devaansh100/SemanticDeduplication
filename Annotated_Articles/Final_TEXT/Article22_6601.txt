Hospitals in the town did report cases of dog bites that day. But even if the dog had turned rabid, the accused could have reported it to the Jetpur municipality. Instead, they chose to beat it to death and committed an offence in the process,‚Äù Majanu Manat, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Jetpur town police, said.']
