The Trishna Wildlife sanctuary in Rajnagar is well known for Bison. However, it is unclear how many individuals were involved in the poaching of the bison. Locals opined that the poaching of bison inside a protected forest is impossible without the help of forest staff. “It is evident that forest staff is involved and these animals are facing the brunt of it,” a local said. The incident has brought to light the active presence of poachers in the region and poaching activities will be difficult to curb without stern measures in place. The Tripura government had taken a project for bison safari at the Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary a a couple of years ago. The number of bisons is gradually increasing in the sanctuary.
