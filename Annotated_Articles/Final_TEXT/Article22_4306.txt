['Goat And Rooster Rescue Chicken From Hawk\nIt’s always sunny on a farm such as this if you have amazing friends willing to defend you from predators. One lucky chicken realized how important it is to have friends who have your back no matter what. In a hawk attack caught on camera, a helpless chicken could only wait for its rooster and goat friends to defend it. And defend they did. In the now-viral video, the hawk can be seen swooping in for the kill. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZr9PUfjkQE As the chicken runs to the boundary, a rooster comes charging, and the three wrestle and move towards the left corner, as seen on camera. No more than a few seconds later, a goat comes charging at the lot. The hawk had no choice but to give up. The episode lasted no more than 15 seconds or so, apparently. The incident reportedly took place in Gelderland, in the Netherlands, on September 5.  YouTube screengrab/ViraloQ News According to news.com.auJaap Beets, the 59-year-old farmer whose property the event took place on, could hear the scuffle going on outside. He told SWNS, “I was so proud of the rooster and the goat jumping in to defend our chicken. I was also very relieved that the chicken survived.”  YouTube screengrab/ViraloQ News The chicken is reported to have suffered minor injuries but being around friends has helped her recover. The report goes on to confirm that this was just another episode in a series of similar events on the farm. “In the seven years I have lived here, it’s the third attack on our chickens,” he said. “This was the second from a goshawk and the other was a buzzard,” he explained. Year amazing rescue indeed. Know of more such stories? Let us know in the comments sections below. Even better, head here for more fun trending stories. (h/t: news.com.au)']
