As per reports, the coupleâ€”Mukesh and Gudiya were returning from Khermai temple, situated some one-and-half kilometres from the district headquarters at around 6.30 am on Sunday when their paths crossed with a bear, less than 1 km from their house. Though the couple confronted the bear together to save each other, they were ripped to pieces by the animal. Eyewitnesses told police that the bear tore apart their body parts, and dragged them to a nullah where it fed on them for four hours. Though the locals tried to chase away the animal while it was eating the body parts, it went in vain. The bear was caught after five hours only after the officials of the forest department reached the spot after receiving information and managed to tranquilize the sloth bear , the official said.
