['Environment & Wildlife Society\nHow Can You Help an Animal in Danger? If you get to see an animal injured in a road accident or is very sick, you should find a veterinary physician in the neighborhood. As a next step, organize an auto-rickshaw for smaller animals such as dogs, cats and a LCV truck for larger animals such as cows, donkeys and other large animals. After covering the eyes and the mouth of the animal with piece of cloth such as old towel, bed-sheet or even a gunny bag, transfer the animal into the vehicle, with the help of locals at the site. Once you have reached the Vet clinic, seek help from their assistants to take the animal into the clinic for treatment.']
