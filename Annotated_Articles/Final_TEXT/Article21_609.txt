['Crackdown on tiger, leopard body parts traders; 2 held\nNagpur: In a joint action, the Melghat Tiger Reserve Cyber Cell and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Mumbai, nabbed two persons and seized 11 tiger as well as leopard nails from them.Last month, 10 tiger and leopard nails were seized from Motala in Buldhana district by the forest department with inputs from cyber cell and WCCB.The accused have been identified as Dinesh Babulalji Rawal (38), and Anup Arun Rewankar (36), both residents of Karad in Satara district. The accused were planning to sell the remaining nails.Acting on information that a person had struck a deal for two nails, forest officials laid a trap in Budhwar Peth area and pounced on Rawal when he was to deliver the material to a decoy sent by the forest teams.Simultaneously, another raid was conducted on Rewankar, who runs a jewellery shop in Raviwar Peth. Officials seized eight nails from him and also a locket embedded with a tiger nail.“Both the accused were booked under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They were remanded in forest custody (FCR) till August 20 by SS Wankore, judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), Karad. They seem to habitual offenders. We are also investigating the links from where the tigers and leopards were killed,” said ACF and investigating officer Mahesh Zhajurne.This is the second joint action in a month by Melghat Cyber Cell & WCCB involving trading of tiger and leopard body parts.On July 13, in a joint action under Melghat field director Jayoti Banerjee and WCCB director Yogesh Warkhad, forest officials had arrested three persons and seized 10 tiger and leopard nails from Motala in Buldhana.“We have sent the seized nails from Motala to Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, for forensic test. Investigations to find the source of animals are still going on. There is a need to find out whether the accused arrested from Karad and Buldhana are linked,” said senior officers handling the probe.']
