['Private taxidermy museum with over 1,000 stuffed animals found in Spain\nSpainâ€™s Civil Guard says it is investigating a businessman in the eastern Valencia region who owned a private taxidermy collection with more than 1,000 stuffed animals, including just over 400 from protected species and at least one specimen of a North African oryx, already extinct. The collection would fetch 29 million euros ($31.5 million) on the black market, the Civil Guard said Sunday in a statement, adding that its owner could be charged with trafficking and other crimes against the environment. It said the finding was the largest of protected stuffed specimens in Spain.']
