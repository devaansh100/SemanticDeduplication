The suricates escaped their cages to leave sailors scrambling to catch them. While Doris, a female was caught, her companion named Boris managed to jump overboard. A skipper jumped overboard to rescue meerkat named Boris that made his bid for freedom off the coast of England The captive meerkat had managed to escape his cat cage and jumped 30 feet off a boat called Gry Maritha when Captain Tom Sexton sprang into action, stripped to his boxers and dove straight in. Boris, however, wasn’t the only one who nearly broke away. His companion, another meerkat named Doris , fled her cage in her bid for freedom - only to be caught. The mongoose were being relocated from their old home in the Isles of Scilly to the Axe Valley Zoo in southwest England’s Devon County. “I think the owner originally had four of them in a sort of little petting zoo at his council house,” Sexton told Metro . “Two of them were in this cat carrier style box but managed to figure out how to break out while we were sailing,” he recalled. Once the meerkats were loose, they were running around on the deck and, at times, hid under cars and crates. The tired boatmen, five of them, who were trying to catch the animals eventually gave up and decided they will try after they moor at a port in Cornwall However, when they did go after the suricates, armed with brooms and gloves, the sailors could only capture Doris, as Boris the meerkat jumped overboard. “I decided I’d jump in and grab him so I stripped off down to my boxers and put on some gloves to go get him,” the ship captain said, adding that he knew the meerkat could be “quite nippy”. “I was surprised how easy it was to get him though. We then put him back in his box and hoisted him back onto the deck.” While Sexton may think he had the last laugh, it was the meerkat who got him out of his uniform.']
