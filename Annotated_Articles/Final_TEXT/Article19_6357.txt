['Our Greed, Their Death: Body Of A Leopard With Its Head & Paws Cut Off, Found In Maharashtra\nIn another gut-wrenching story of a voiceless creature being tortured by humans, the carcass of a leopard was found on Wardha-Mandwa road in Maharashtra, with its head and paws cut off.  Cases of animal cruelty are on the rise and it’s hard to understand how people can be so heartless, so as to mercilessly murder an animal. Despite a widespread call for appropriate punishment, things seem to be getting worse. Representational Image - Unsplash A gut-wrenching picture of a leopard, with its head and paws are cut off was posted on Twitter by IFS Parveen Kaswan. He captioned the picture ‘This #Leopard was found on a road at Maharashtra. His Head & paws were cut off. Now his nails, teeths etc will be sold in the market. Wildlife crime is a demand-based business. Say no to all kinds of animal products. Like this thousands are killed annually for their body parts. Tragic’. Here’s the picture: Graphic image. Viewer discretion advised. This #Leopard was found on a road at Maharashtra. His Head & paws were cut off. Now his nails, teeths etc will be sold in market. Wildlife crime is a demand based business.

Tragic pic.twitter.com/gmjfgYmgtg — Parveen Kaswan, IFS (@ParveenKaswan) December 13, 2019   Four people from Wadhghar have been arrested for committing the crime and body parts of the innocent animal have been seized from them. According to Wardha deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Sunil Sharma, the carcass was noticed by Mandwa villagers. “Investigations are still on,” said Sharma. According to assistant commissioner of animal husbandry and veterinarian, Dr SB Bagal - who conducted the post-mortem of the animal - the leopard seems to have died after getting trapped in wires laid by the four people. Bagal also said that the carcass had scratch marks on it.

No bloodstains were found at the spot where the animal was found,” said Bagal. This is the third leopard death in the region in the last three days, according to Times Of India. Two leopards died in the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve area in Maharashtra, in the last two days. It is really unfair that the voiceless creatures have to suffer the brunt of human greed, and it is beyond barbaric to butcher an animal to sell its body parts to make money.']
