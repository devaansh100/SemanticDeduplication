Great job handling the snake with ease and a bit of prep work — Shankar (@pbshankar) February 3, 2022 Several people were appreciative of the forest official’s bravery in handling the snake. Wow what a courageous lady. She has been well trained. I think women should get encouraged more and more. They can do wonders. — Vishal Pandey (@imvishalkpandey) February 3, 2022 Others commented that while the incident was commendable, more precautionary measures, such as PPEs of some kind, should be given to people involved in rescuing a snake. Even If rained they should have some kind of PPE for such dangerous acts. Only 2 days before a trained and very experienced snake catcher in Kerala was bitten by King Cobra.
