Had it been a more targeted firing, the animal could have died by now," said regional chief conservator of forests (Angul) M Yogajayanand."It\'s a miracle that it managed to survive," he added.The elephant has bullet wounds in its right thigh region, trunk, top portion of head, near left ear and shoulder. The wound in right thigh has developed septicaemia , a severe form of bacterial infection, officials said."Antibiotics have been administered and the elephant is responding to the medication. We certainly hope that it survives," said the senior forest officer.While the forest department claimed that some people encountered the elephant inadvertently and out of fear shot at it to save themselves, wildlife campaigners dismissed the claim, saying the belt where the jumbo was shot at is poaching-prone and several incidents of poaching have come to light in the past."It is a lame excuse by the forest department, which has no takers. It is a matter of common sense that a tusker has been targeted," alleged wildlife campaigner Biswajit Mohanty."It\'s a miracle that it\'s fighting so much," he added.Forest officials said the place where the elephant was found with the bullet injuries two days ago, is just one km from human habitation.']
