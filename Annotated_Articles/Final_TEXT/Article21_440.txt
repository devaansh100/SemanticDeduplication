Preceding this, last year, various rhino horns, found in the national park, were deposited by these two arrested personnel pair to the park authorities. Nonetheless, they figured out how to keep a piece of such horns and were in search of rhino horn dealers. In any case, they couldn\'t exchange this piece of rhino horn as coronavirus limitations were declared in Assam.  Of late, it became exposed that a disagreement occurred between the two personnel which prompted the disclosure of the act that they committed and the DFO had the option to confine them alongside the broken piece of the rhino horn. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, a case has been enrolled and DFO Gogoi has started an investigation as to this matter.  Last Sunday, a forest department personnel has been suspended for an "unwanted firing" at a Royal Bengal tiger in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve a couple of days ago. An authority release stated that an inquiry directed by the Assistance Conservator of Forests into the incident revealed that the firing was ridiculous based on which the staff concerned was suspended.
