Aged 5-6, the leopard's body was found near the Pimpri Pendhar village in Junnar taluka of Pune rural district midnight on Friday. Preliminary inputs suggest that an unidentified vehicle ran over the big cat sometime on Thursday evening. Locals spotted the carcass and informed local forest department officials who arrived at the spot and recovered the body. It was later sent for post-mortem and further details are awaited regarding the exact time and cause of the leonine's death. According to a report by Mirror Online, this is the fifth leopard death reported on the Kalyan-Ahmednagar highway this year. Conservationists have been stressing the need for an action plan to reduce the leopard mortality rate which was the highest since 2014 last year. In its report, Delhi-based Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) had stated that 74 per cent of leopard deaths reported from across the country in 2018, was caused due to train or road accidents. In 2017, the number of leopard deaths was 431 as compared to 440 in 2016, 399 in 2015 and 331 in 2014. This number was 460 in 2018. Apart from accidents, leopards also die after falling into open wells or poaching. The demand for leopard skin is huge in international markets and attracts hundreds of poachers who hunt these majestic animals despite stringent measures listed as deterrents against such crimes in the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Recently, the centre proposed an action plan to include safe corridors for tigers and other animals in infrastructure projects across India. If implemented, the plan can work towards balancing the man-animal conflict which has been brewing in developing countries like India since time immemorial and has claimed the lives of innocent citizens."]
