With the help of the specialised camera, users are able to show others what they see while engaging in activities like scuba-diving, sky-diving, bungee jumping, and other activities that cannot be paired with regular cameras. However, a new GoPro footage has captivated netizens the world over because it was neither planned nor was the camera attached to a user. It actually showed a parrot\'s getaway after the bird stole the camera from a group of hikers in New Zealand. The footage is online now because the hikers managed to retrieve the camera eventually. Watch it here: The unexpected bird\'s eye view was witnessed by a New Zealand family hiking in Fiordland National Park, South Island. The mischievous parrot swooped down, stole their GoPro, and flew off while they were just about to finish exploring a part of the Kepler Track, said reports. The kea, which is Aotearoa’s native alpine parrot species, are known for their mischievous nature and for swiping packed boxes, wallets, and jewellery from unsuspecting visitors. In this case, the Verheul family became the one cheeky kea’s latest victim. The theft happened shortly after a family member turned on the device to film a group of curious birds outside the hut they were staying at. The GoPro camera wasn\'t being carried around by anyone. It was placed outside to film the birds, said reports. The footage shows the bird at one point ripping off a chunk of plastic from the camera\'s casing. The camera survived the ordeal and a family member was able to recover it a short distance from where it was stolen. The family member told a news publication they were able to locate the camera as the parrot flew in a straight line. "We just followed the sound, went down there, could see them hanging out in the tree. They\'d obviously heard us coming and abandoned the GoPro -- and my son, he decided to go check the rocks... and there it was, just sitting there, still filming," said Alex Verhaul. Following the recovery, the footage was transferred to a phone and shared online.']
