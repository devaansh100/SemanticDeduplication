['Five acquitted in 2009 tiger killing case\nPanaji/Valpoi: A local court acquitted five persons accused in the death of a tiger — two of killing the cat and three of destroying evidence. The court stated that the prosecution failed to examine eye-witnesses, and failed to even prove that the tiger was killed.The judicial magistrate first class, Sattari, Jude Sequeira, found that the statements of accused Suryakant Majik, Ankush Majik, and Bhiva alias Pintoo Vaman Gawas, who were accused of destroying evidence, didn’t corroborate with each other and didn’t complete the chain.Finding no direct evidence, the court gave the accused the benefit of doubt. Judge Jude Sequeira found that while the prosecution was able to prove the presence of tigers in Keri, it failed to prove the photograph, failed to examine eye-witnesses, which was fatal to the case.TOI published the story and photo of the dead tiger on its edition dated April 13, 2009.“It was incumbent upon the investigating officers to record the statements of the said witnesses or for that matter make attempts in investigation to record their statements,” judge Sequeira said.The court also found that the articles found at the site — blood-stained stones, tiger hair, mud with blood stains, charcoal, burnt bones, jaws, and teeth, which the deputy conservator of forest sent for examination were, not examined, and there was no expert evidence to say that the articles attached belonged to a dead tiger, proving fatal to the case of the prosecution. Prosecution witness S K Gupta stated that he only conducted a test on one sample, “and his report is in respect of only one sample, that is, a hair”.The court also found “no justification” as to why Gupta didn’t analyse or examine other samples sent to him.The prosecution stated that the tiger was killed in the last week of February 2009. “The articles/evidence which the prosecution claims belongs to the tiger were found on May 30 and June 1, 2009. There is a gap of nearly three months between the killing of the alleged tiger and discovery of articles/evidence,” the court said.“Considering that the discovery was made after three months of killing of the tiger, it was incumbent upon the prosecution or for that matter Gupta to examine all the articles which were sent to him for analysis/examination. There is every possibility that the hair/fur which was analyzed by Gupta could have been of any tiger,” the court stated.The court also said that the fur, without analysis or examination, cannot conclusively be said to have been of the tiger that was allegedly killed by Ganesh Majik and Nagesh Majik.The court further stated that one cartridge was found at the spot on July 17, 2009, but the counsel representing the accused submitted that during the panchanama on May 30 and June 1, 2009, the investigating officer, including 25-30 forest guards, did not find the cartridge which was allegedly found on July 17, and alleged it was planted.The court found contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution as to whether the tiger was cut into pieces and then burnt, or cut into pieces and then destroyed.']
