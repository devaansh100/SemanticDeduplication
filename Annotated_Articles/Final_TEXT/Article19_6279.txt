The shocking experiment was carried out in a show called Kings of Pain Pythons are not venomous snakes. But they are nasty constrictors with the strength to crush a prey’s bones in a matter of seconds. While their bites are not fatal to humans and other animals, they can inflict deep wounds with their fangs. Recently, when an adventurous TV presenter tried finding out the fang strength of a fully-grown python, he realised it was much more than he had anticipated. The man was left screaming in agony after he let a six-foot python bite him on his left arm. The footage of the incident shows the man’s lacerated arm with a fang hanging out of it. Watch it here: Adam Thorn, the presenter of popular TV show ‘In The Name of Science’, wore a protective mask and a groin cover and let the snake take a bite out of his left arm. The moment the python sinks its fangs on Thorn’s arm, he starts screaming in pain. A few seconds later, the reptile tries coiling itself around Thorn’s arm but is stopped by co-host Rob Alleva The shocking experiment was carried out in a show called Kings of Pain. The slow-motion footage revealed the snake attacked first with its lower jaw before dislocating the upper jaw. Thorn, who is also a wildlife biologist, appeared to be pretty shaken after the incident. He eventually needed stitches on his left arm. Both Thorn and Alleva have travelled around the world to get bitten by insects, snakes and all sorts of dangerous animals. If that is not adventurous enough, the pair have even devised a 30-point scale to measure the amount of pain they experience during their experiments. The scale measures the duration, intensity, and damage caused by the attack.']
