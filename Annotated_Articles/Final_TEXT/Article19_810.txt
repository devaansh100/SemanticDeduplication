More than 20 people have been harmed so far by the animal, said residents.Despite repeated requests, villagers said the revenue as well as forest department officials have not taken any action.“A few forest officials who came could not catch the animal,” they alleged. Forest officials who have been camping at the village said they have been trying day and night to catch the simian for the last five days. However, the monkey could not be trapped in a cage or net, he said.“The animal may have been separated from its troop and this aggression could be stress-induced, or it may be a manifestation of some internal injury,” the officials said.On information, district forest officer Naga Sathish Giladi arrived at the village on Thursday evening and held talks with the villagers and assured them to trap the animal within two days.“We are trying to capture the animal by tranquillising it with the help of veterinarians. A total of 10 staffers from the forest department have been moving around the village with a trap,” the forest officer said.He also said a medical team would arrive at the village to treat people who have been bit by the monkey.']
