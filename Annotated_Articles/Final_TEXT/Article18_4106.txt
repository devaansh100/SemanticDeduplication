['Four leopard cubs reunited with mother\nPune: Four leopard cubs were rescued and reunited with their mother on Tuesday after efforts made by the NGO Wildlife SOS and the Junnar forest division. The cubs were spotted by local farmers while harvesting sugarcane in the Kabadwadi village.The agrarians immediately contacted the forest department, who called the Wildlife SOS team operating out of the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Center for reinforcements.They carried out a reunion operation on the same farm successfully.Upon first arriving at the location, Wildlife SOS veterinary doctor Nikhil Bangar identified the cubs as two females and two males, approximately two months of age. The leopard cubs were taken to the centre for medical examination. They were found to be in good health and fit to be reunited with their mother.To ensure a successful reunion, the team waited until nightfall to set the operation in motion as leopards are most active during this time. The cubs were placed in a safe box and kept in the same location they were found in. Camera traps were installed to monitor the cubs, confirming that they were successfully reunited with their mother.Bangar told TOI, “Conducting a reunion at night is integral to a successful operation, keeping in mind the nocturnal nature of leopards. Further, there is minimal human presence during nighttime, giving the mother enough time to find and secure her cubs.”']
