The video, which was shared by IFS officer Susanta Nanda on Twitter, shows how a jump helped a leopard cheat death. The 9-second video shows a hyena attacking a leopard and the latter avoiding a collision. However, the leopard displays an incredible reflex and jumps over the hyena and within moments, is seen climbing up a tree. "Sometimes the gap between life & death is a jump. Lions & hyenas are the only animals who occasionally attack adult leopards with fatal blows. It avoids risk to injury or death fighting a hyena," Nanda wrote while sharing the video.
