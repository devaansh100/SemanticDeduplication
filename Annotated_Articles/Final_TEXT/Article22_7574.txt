Conservationists are flummoxed at this rare occurrence By Rahul Noronha: A man and his wife were killed by a sloth bear in a forest about 3 km from Madhya Pradesh’s Panna town on the morning of June 5. While fatalities from sloth bear attacks are fairly common among people, eyewitnesses in this case were aghast to see the bear clawing out and consuming the flesh of the victims, Panna town residents Mukesh and his wife Gudiya Rai, for close to three hours. A rescue team called in from the adjoining Panna National Park tranquilised the bear and put it in an enclosure in the park. The animal died a few hours later. advertisement Panna North divisional forest officer Gaurav Sharma told INDIA TODAY that Mukesh and Gudiya had gone to fill water at a nullah in a forest close to the Khermai temple. According to witnesses, a sloth bear that had also come to the nullah to drink water mauled Gudiya, killing her instantly. Mukesh tried to save his wife and was also killed by the bear. The witnesses called locals from Panna town, who fired guns in the air but failed to get the bear to budge. “We saw the bear walking from one body to another, clawing out flesh and eating it. It is a very rare occurrence. While sloth bears eat meat, they are not known to consume human flesh, not even of those they have killed,” said Sharma. Park authorities tried to explain the behaviour of the bear by claiming that the animal could be suffering from rabies. “Prima facie the bear seems to have been afflicted with rabies and was in its last stages. Rabies explains the odd behaviour of the sloth bear,” said Uttam Kumar Sharma, field director of Panna National Park. He added that no human flesh had been found in the bear’s stomach during post-mortem. “Feeding on a human body after killing it is extremely rare and almost unheard of [in bears]. It seems this particular bear was very hungry and driven to desperation. Also, the animal being found close to water does not sync with the animal having rabies. Anyone or anything afflicted with rabies stays clear of water,” says R.N. Saxena, former principal chief conservator of forests, Madhya Pradesh. A compensation of Rs 4 lakh has been announced for the next of kin of the victims. Subscribe to India Today Magazine --- ENDS ---']
