But to everyone's relief, the zookeepers managed to lure the bear into an indoor part of the cage so that staff could manage to rescue the child. Surprisingly, the mother keeps watching this whole incident. Later, she was detained and faces a criminal case for attempted murder, say reports in Tashkent. The girl is being treated in hospital for a head injury and cuts from the fall. The zoo's spokesperson said that the woman threw her baby girl in the bear's den in front of everyone.
