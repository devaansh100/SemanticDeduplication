['Hundreds of Cockroaches released in Courtroom during hearing, 1 Arrested\nAccording to Court Officials, hundreds of cockroaches were released in a New York courtroom during an altercation that broke out at an arraignment on Tuesday. The bizarre incident happened in Albany City Court after a defendant who began to film the courtroom proceedings was told to stop. In an altercation that followed, hundreds of cockroaches that were brought into the courthouse in plastic containers were released. The Court was closed for the rest of the day for fumigation while the bug release is being investigated. A 34-year-old woman in the audience was arrested for charges related to the altercation, including disorderly conduct, obstructing governmental administration & tampering with physical evidence, the news agency reported. She was later released. "What transpired is not advocacy or activism, it is criminal behaviour with the intent to disrupt a proceeding & cause damage," the Office of Court Administration said in a statement.
