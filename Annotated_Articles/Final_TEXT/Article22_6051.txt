Noor Ahmed and Anjanappa, all employees of a nearby coffee estate, went fishing and returned with a pair of tusks of an elephant that had died naturally. While they did not kill the tusker, sources in the Chikkamagaluru forest mobile squad told TOI they were arrested while looking for prospective buyers.Possession and sale of elephant tusk are prohibited. The tusks were found in a rivulet near the Kathlekhan coffee estate in Bababudan Giri mountain range, sources said, adding all the accused were aged between 25 and 30 years. Illegal entry into a tiger reserve is punishable with a jail term of minimum 3 to 7 years and a fine of Rs 1 lakh under the Wildlife Act.LM Sharath, sub-inspector, Chikkamagalur FMS, said: “Three of the accused sneaked into BTR and reached the rivulet, which is 200m from their estate boundary. While waiting to catch fish, they stumbled upon an elephant’s skeleton in the stream. Much to their surprise, the skull was intact with a pair of tusks. Hoping to pay off their debts, they planned to sell it.”He added that they were raided while scouting for prospective buyers in Chikkamagaluru town and arrested. “The stream is located deep inside the forest and has slippery banks. The water gushes in great speed and the elephant may have died 3-4 years ago after falling into the stream. Over the years, parts of the skeleton were washed away in the stream water,” explained Saiyyad Hussaini, assistant conservator of forests, who was present during the mahajar.Investigators recovered a few bones of the elephant 500m downstream. Later, the officials registered a case based on the statements made by the culprits and spot inspection. “The accused may not have been hunters or poachers. They accidentally came into possession of the skeleton. But they sneaked illegally inside a protected area. It is important to obtain permission to enter a protected area and hand over anything they find within the forest to forest officials,” a senior forest official said.']
