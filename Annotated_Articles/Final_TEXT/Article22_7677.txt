What grabbed our attention the most is the second part of the clip. A man, probably the owner, can be seen reaching to the tiger as it rests on the road, escorting the wild animal, and slipping a rope around its neck like it was a small pet dog. Khatron Ke Khiladi enough? Netizens are stunned after watching the video.
