He stepped out of his car to rescue the poor animal crossing the road. A viral video, that has resurfaced on the internet, shows how the man wrapped a sweater around the sloth and carried it out of harmâ€™s way to a roadside tree. The sloth gripped the tree and climbed a couple feet before extending its arm towards the man so as to say thank you.']
