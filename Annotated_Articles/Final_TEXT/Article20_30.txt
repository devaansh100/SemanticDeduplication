['Three arrested for poaching peafowls\nPUDUKOTTAI: The forest department arrested three men for hunting three peafowls near Annavasal in Pudukottai district on Monday. A country-made unlicensed gun, a motorcycle and carcasses of the three peafowls were seized from them.The arrested have been identified as C Perumal, 25, P Moorthy, 26 and S Arumugam, 26. Inquiry has brought to light that the three had poached the peafowls for meat and this was not their first attempt.They were caught by the Annavasal police during a vehicle check near Vayalogam village on Sunday night. The trio were handed over to the forest officials on Monday morning.Peafowls are protected under Schedule – I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Poaching them is a non-bailable offence.Pudukottai district forest officer M Anand Kumar said they had secured one more person who had supplied raw materials to the trio to make ammunition for poaching.“Unlike these habitual offenders, people living close to the forest areas indulge in poaching without knowing that such acts can put them behind bars. We have been sensitizing them to keep away from such activities,” said Anand.A case has been booked under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act against the three.']
