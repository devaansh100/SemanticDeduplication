['Watch: Elephant herd crosses busy roads in Odisha\nEvery day more and more forested land is being encroached upon by infrastructure projects like roads and highways. This often prompts wild animals to clash with traffic, causing damage to both animals and humans. However, these clashes can be minimised by timely intervention by authorities like the forest department. And, that was what the department in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj did. On Wednesday, Susanta Nanda, an Indian Forest Services (IFS) officer shared videos that showed a herd of elephants crossing across a human settlement as shocked onlookers filmed them. While sharing this video, the IFS officer wrote, “Refugees in their own land. The herd moving inside a market in Bangiriposhi Range of Mayurbhanj district.” The videos were reportedly taken in the Mayurbhanj district in Odisha. A few minutes later, he shared another video that showed the herd more over to a two-way road as traffic was stopped. “Salutation to the Forest staff for doing an exceptional job in providing them safe passage,” said Nanda.

First we take away their habitat then we oat our backs for providing them safe passage ..what an irony 🙄 — Ranjana (@Ranjana98746130) June 23, 2022 ‘Refugees in their own land’ absolutely right — muralidharan,K (@kmdharan) June 23, 2022 @nitin_gadkari @NHAI_Official we need a elephant corridor and a Link Road to connect road while animals can pass below! Would u take it as a priority and do it, elephant always follow a route if it has passed then this is its general route of travel! — Ashish Mahendra (@ashi_mahe) June 22, 2022 Hope sooner they build a fly over in such regular elephant passages and give safer life n movement for the elephants — Jayasri Benkal (@BenkalJayasri) June 23, 2022 Government should always provide the animals with a safe corridor for their movements, especially Elephants follow the same route always… — Indian (@4_PurelyIndian) June 22, 2022 This is not the solution for the long term — Cauliflower Farmer (@Cauli_farmer) June 22, 2022 Sad state of affairs. Encroaching on their habitat for our selfish gains — 🇮🇳 નારદમુની 🇮🇳 (@LearningSoul_) June 23, 2022 Echoing this opinion, a Twitter user commented under one of the videos, “@nitin_gadkari @NHAI_Official we need a elephant corridor and a Link Road to connect road while animals can pass below! Would u take it as a priority and do it, elephant always follow a route if it has passed then this is its general route of travel!”.']
