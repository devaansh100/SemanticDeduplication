['Old male common leopard saved from conflict situation at Pandu in Guwahati\nThe wildlife rescue team of Assam State Zoo and Botanical Garden, rescued a male common leopard from the human area of Loco Colony Pandu in Guwahati on April 19. “There was a hue and cry since morning around my home as a leopard was sighted in the early morning. People tried no stone unturned to move the animal from the locality. But at last, it reached the backyard of my house and climbed a jackfruit tree,” said Mustak Ali, the resident of the railway quarter where the leopard took shelter. The leopard during his movement severely injured one Manju Bhattacharjee, a local resident of the area who was later admitted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for further treatment. The crowd management in such human -leopard conflict situations is one of the most sensitive parts of the wildlife rescue missions. And the joint team of Assam forest department, Guwahati Police with the CRPF has handled the situation well at Pandu avoiding any kind of untoward incident during rescue operation. Dr Bijoy Gogoi, senior wildlife veterinarian and consultant of Assam State Zoo chemically immobilised the animal with support of the specialised rescue team and successfully shifted it to the zoo for further observation within a very short span of time. The wild animal is an old male common leopard which has probably come out for easy prey search in the area. Moreover, in the last two weeks, people have randomly sighted a common leopard in the locality adjacent to Pandu Nath area which had killed three goats at a household in the western foothills of Kamakhya. Bringing relief to the residents of Loco Colony Pandu, the crisis situation that started in the early April 19 morning at Pandu with the sighting of the animal has come to an end with quick and efficient rescue from the human habitation by the Assam State Zoo team.']
