While the leopard was being captured, a forest guard, identified as BS Waykar, and police constable S Vibhute sustained minor injuries when the leopard attacked them. “The captured leopard is a female and is four to five years old. After the capture, the leopard has been kept at the animal rescue centre in Katraj. It will be released in the wild after a while. Though this particular area has not witnessed leopard sighting before, leopards have been seen in Manjari area, three km away. There is recorded leopard population in adjacent areas like Daund and Shirur, in both forest areas and sugarcane fields. It is possible that this individual has come from one of these places,” said Range Forest officer for Pune, V J Gaikwad.
