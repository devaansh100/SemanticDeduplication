The leopard slid into a toilet as the door was ajar. The guard quickly latched the door from the outside before alerting forest officials.A few onlookers gathered at the spot despite a drizzle at that late hour. But the police controlled the crowd that had started to assemble, said Rohit Mohite, honorary wildlife warden for Thane district. “The leopard was possibly scouting for stray dogs to prey on,” Mohite said, adding that the leopard could have sneaked out of the adjoining Aarey forest as leopards typically do not fancy soggy places.Forest officials and SGNP’s rescue team reached the place. The cat was tranquillised and taken to Sanjay Gandhi National Park, said Dr Shailesh Pethe, deputy commissioner, animal husbandry, Mumbai.A tranquiliser dart was shot from the toilet window, said Aditya Patil of Wildlife Welfare Association. A microchip on the leopard indicates that it had been rescued from Yeoor forest, Thane, in 2020.']
