The man identified as Joseph managed to enter a car near the goose, without getting attacked. He drove out of the parking slot and halted the vehicle between the goose and the woman’s belongings. He ran swiftly and picked them up. Fox5 also reported that Willard later updated on TikTok that a gosling was spotted walking with the geese. In July last year, a pair of geese grabbed attention online. One of the geese underwent surgery in Massachusetts and its mate attempted to enter the clinic but in vain. It was seen waiting at the door throughout the procedure.']
