The big cat had attacked and injured a woman before the operation took place. The injured woman was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, as per reports. “A leopard that had strayed into the Loco Colony of Pandu, Guwahati has been successfully rescued,” tweeted the Assam Forest Department, while sharing a video of the rescue operation. In the clip shared by state forest department, a man can be seen holding a tranquilised leopard on a tree while the other man spreads a net to capture the animal. In another 9-second short clip, leopard can be later seen falling in the net as part of the rescue operation. Check the video here: As per the forest officials, the animal was later taken to the Assam State Zoo for treatment. While many viewers may be surprised to see how the animal was rescued, this is not the only time that such an attempt by forest officials has garnered social media attention. A tiger that was being released into the Sundarbans a part of a rescue operation, was filmed jumping off the boat and swimming away without a backward glance. The clip went viral and prompted many users to compare the scene with the 2012 film Life Of Pi. In February, a video of state forest officials rescuing an elephant from a ditch in West Bengal’s Midnapore went viral. The clip was shared by DFO (District Forest Officer) Sandeep Berwal on his Twitter handle. In the viral video, the young elephant can be seen struggling to get out of the pit.
