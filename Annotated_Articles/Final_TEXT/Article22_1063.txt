['Reptiles – The woman on the mountain\nHearing a mighty fuss in the trees outside my study window, I checked. A very agitated Peewee was fluttering and noisily protesting all around a tall tree which a goanna was trying to climb. Its antics were clearly bothering the goanna. I suppose the small Peewee felt safe, even at such close quarters, as the goanna had to keep its claws holding on to the bark rather than swiping at the annoying bird. The Peewee won, with the goanna giving up the attempt to go further up that tree, and beginning the awkward about-turn. Peewees are famous for their noisy and fearless defence of their territory, often against much bigger birds. Or reptiles! You may have seen them attacking their own reflections in windows or car side-mirrors, thinking themselves to be enemies. Goannas’ downward climbs don’t look very safe or easy, with those claws needing to defy gravity for the heavy body. In fact, their manner of changing direction in tree branches looks quite precarious altogether. Having made it, this one seemed to simply want to rest, supported by the branch, and right way up. As the Peewee warrior was nowhere in sight or earshot, that branch must not be deemed a threat. The goanna was permitted to rest in peace.']
