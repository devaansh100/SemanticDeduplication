The deer, which strayed on the national highway, died after they were hit by unidentified vehicles.Forest department sources said that on Thursday around 1am, a two-year-old female spotted deer that strayed on the Trichy-Thanjavur national highway near Ganesa roundabout was hit by a vehicle. It sustained multiple fractures in its legs and was moved to the Palakkarai animal husbandry hospital by onlookers and animal activists. It succumbed to injuries later in the day.It is suspected that the animal could have escaped the deer park situated in Bhel township where hundreds of spotted deer are housed. The district forest department said that they are yet to ascertain the nativity of the deer. “The deer park in Bhel is well caged and it is very rare for the animal to escape. At the same time, there is no reserved forest nearby, we will inspect the deer park in Bhel,” an official source said.In a similar incident, a two-year-old female spotted deer succumbed to injuries after being hit by a vehicle at Maravanoor near Manapparai on Trichy-Dindigul NH. Since there is no reserve forest in a 10km radius of the accident spot, forest personnel are clueless from where the deer came. The carcass of two dead spotted deer were buried after post mortem. Forest department officials said that they will probe both the incidents to identify the cause and prevent the spotted deer from straying on to the national highways.']
