The accused, Rakesh Dhulap (27) from Lanja, was to sell the scales, said the police.It is illegal to hunt or sell body parts of a pangolin as the species is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. However, its meat is in demand for consumption and for “medicinal” purpose while the scales are used in superstition activity. Sources said that a rising number of cases of poaching of the pangolin in Ratnagiri district could be an indicator of a wildlife racket.Officials did not specify monetary value of the scales as laws do not permit this.The pangolin scales weighing 4.3kg were found in a bag. The motorcycle and cellphone of the accused have been confiscated and he has been sent to police custody till Tuesday, said Hemantkumar Shah, crime branch inspector, Ratnagiri.A criminal offence has been registered, said Dinkar Surya, assistant inspector at Ratnagiri rural police.']
