The man in the video claims him to be ‘Snake God’ because he wrestles with such a long reptile daily. Jay Brewer is reportedly a reptile zoo owner and an avid Youtuber. He reportedly started his life with snakes when he was a young boy. As reported in Opera News Jay Brewer bought a small pet store when he was left on his own at the young age of 14. The small pet store now turned into ‘The Reptile Zoo’. It houses now over 100 species of reptiles, amphibians, and arachnids. Besides pythons, we can also find alligators, iguanas, giant tortoises, and monitor lizards at the Reptile Zoo of Jay. In the video we come across multiple clips where Joe is seen along with giant reptiles including a 20 feet long python. Accompanied by her daughter the python was carried to another room where, Joe wrestled with the python to make it straight so that the accurate length of the huge reptile can be measured.
