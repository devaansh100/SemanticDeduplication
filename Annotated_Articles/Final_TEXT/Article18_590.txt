['Elusive leopard trapped in Etawah Lion Safari\nKanpur: A leopard, which had killed several blackbuck deer in the Etawah Lion Safari over two months, fell in the trap placed by the forest department on Tuesday night, much to the relief of the safari authorities.The carnivore, which was moving around the buffer zone of the safari for more than two months and killed several blackbucks, was spotted in the video-footage in April. The death of the blackbucks had drawn criticism from Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav.Subsequently, the safari authorities placed several cages in the buffer zone.In order to attract the big cat, a goat was tied inside the cage located near the chain link fencing in the safari. However, the four-five years old male leopard kept on dodging the safari authorities.However, it ran out of luck and was trapped in one of the cages at around 1:13 am on Tuesday.The leopard is healthy and is in fine condition and will be released in the wild soon. Etawah Safari Park deputy director Arun Kumar Singh said, “A rescue operation was being carried out to catch the leopard for more than three months. It was caught on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. It got trapped in the cage placed on the outer edge of the chain link fencing of the Leopard Safari area.”“It is being shifted to the transportation cage under the supervision of a veterinarian and biologist. The leopard was medically examined by the vet,” said Singh further.On April 1, the leopard had entered the deer safari in the Lion Safari Park on April 1 from the Fisher Forest area. After this, the death of three deer came to light.SP chief had even attacked the state government over the deaths of deer in Lion Safari. He had tweeted a photo of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav ’s safari tour and asked the government to adopt preventive measures with regard to the death of deer in the safari.']
