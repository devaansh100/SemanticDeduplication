Warangal: A team of Commissioner’s Task Force police apprehended two persons while attempting to sell a leopard skin at Khanapur village in the district, and seized the hide worth estimated at Rs 20 lakh from the duo on Tuesday. The accused were identified as Boda Balakrishna (28) of Pokalagudem village, and Badavath Tirupathi (63) Pusala Thanda, Palvancha mandal of the Bhadradri-Kothagudem district. According to Warangal Police Commissioner Dr Tarun Joshi, the prime accused Balakrishna and Tirupathi were habitual hunters who visit the forest for hunting the animals. “They met three persons from Odisha State who have been living in Kothagudem forest area, and the Odia people had reportedly said that they hunted leopard and kept the skin at their house. If any buyer is there, they will be selling the leopard skin for Rs 12 Lakh. Following this, Boda Balakrishna and Tirupathi made an agreement with them and paid advance Rs 30,000 in advance, and got the leopard skin and brought to their house. On Tuesday (February 08), the accused contacted one prospective buyer to sell for Rs 20 lakh. The buyer said to them to bring the hide to Khanapur village of Warangal district,” he said and added that the Task Force, who received reliable information, nabbed Balakrishna and Thirupathi while they were waiting for the buyer under a water tank in order to sell the illegally obtained leopard skin. “Later, the police informed the Forest department officials regarding the seizure of the leopard hide. A team of foresters arrived at the scene and certified that the skin is an authentic leopard skin. A confession and seizure ‘panchanama’ was conducted as per The Wildlife Protection Act-1972,” the CP said and added that efforts were being made to apprehend the remaining culprits. “As the offence attracts several penal provisions of Wildlife Protection Act 1972, the case is being handed over to Forest Department for further investigation,” Dr Joshi said and congratulated the Task Force team including Inspector R Santosh for nabbing the poachers.
