Their domestic hens incubated these eggs. The peachicks born to these eggs are the result of their care and fostering. So, we did not book them,” he said.Ranger of Garu West, Tarun Kumar Singh , said, “I recovered five peachicks from a house at Jhumri village under Bareysanr range of the reserve around five days ago. I recovered another three peachicks from a house at Mangra village on the same day. The recovered peachicks are presentlyunder our care at Chhipadohar east range.”']
