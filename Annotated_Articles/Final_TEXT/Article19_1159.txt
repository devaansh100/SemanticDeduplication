The big cat was reportedly spotted about 2 km from the city airport, the Biju Patnaik airport, in an area which neighbours Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's residence. The matter came to light when locals alerted wildlife officials about the animal scaling a boundary wall and entering the premises of a commercial establishment in the area on Sunday night. Acting promptly, forest rangers dispatched a team of 25 personnel to Palaspalli on Monday after verifying CCTV footage showing the big cat roaming in the area.

He added that if disturbed, the animal might turn hostile. Mishra also said that the animal could have strayed from nearby Chandaka forest, adding that it is 'unusual' for a leopard to be spotted in Palaspalli. A similar situation had come to light from Hyderabad last week when a leopard scare gripped areas around the Hyderabad University campus. The big cat was first spotted near the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropic (ICRISAT), an area from where forest rangers captured a leaoped in 2014. While addressing the concerns of local residents, a wildlife official had stated that trap cages and cameras have been set up in the area to rescue the big cat before it causes any harm to locals.
