When asked to explain, Mohideen said that the stroller bag had been given to him by someone outside Bangkok airport with instructions to hand it over some unknown person outside Chennai airport who would identify him by his photo. Officials took him outside the airport but no one turned up to receive the same even after waiting for a considerable time. Authorities then called Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) officials to identify the wild species. A team of veterinary doctors from Arignar Anna Zoological Park inspected animals and found them to be in a healthy condition. Animal quarantine officials recommended deporting the wildlife species back to the country of origin as the passenger did not have any NOC/ DGFT license for import into India.
