['Adult elephant stuck in wetland in Assam’s Golaghat, dies\nGUWAHATI: A tusk-less adult elephant was found dead in a wetland in upper Assam’s Golaghat district, as informed by forest officials on Saturday. Reportedly, the elephant had fallen into the Sungihola Beel (Borbeel), a water-body under Khumtai area and got stuck there. Thereafter, forest officials reached the spot and made the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) authorities in Kaziranga aware of the situation. However, they were asked to keep an eye on the elephant’s efforts in coming out of the wetland on its own. As per reports, in the evening, it was witnessed by the forest personnel that the elephant was trying its best to come out of the wetland but unfortunately, the efforts went in vain as it failed to come out after a few unsuccessful attempts. Officials said that personnel then took a boat and went close to the elephant and found it to be dead. The body of the elephant was pulled out of the wetland on Saturday morning with the support of a crane. An inquiry has been ordered regarding the incident by the forest department, as informed by the officials. Ritu Paban Borah, Assistant Conservator of Forest was instructed to probe the death of the elephant under Section 50 (8) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
