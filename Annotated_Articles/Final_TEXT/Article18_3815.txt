Only Karnataka recorded more such deaths with 98 between 2011 and 2021.However, poachers killed more elephants in both Kerala (20) and Karnataka (12) than in Tamil Nadu (eight) during the same period.The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change provided this data in response to an RTI query from Chennai-based activist Antony Clement Rubin . The ministry had categorised deaths of wild elephants under four categories - train accidents, electrocution, poaching and poisoning.In Tamil Nadu, there was no case of elephant deaths due to poisoning between 2011 and 2021. Kerala had two deaths in the period.Asian elephant expert R Sukumar of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said that in the southern states, wild elephant deaths largely occur outside the Project Elephant reserves.More and more elephants are going out of the forest areas in search of food and water bringing them into conflict with farmers. This is because the native grass in forests, which the elephants depend on, is giving way to invasive species and weeds. So the elephants venture out and raid farms with paddy, sugarcane and other crops, Sukumar said.Thirty years ago his team had submitted a detailed report demarcating the elephant movement areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The landscape is interconnected and was demarcated as 'Project Elephant reserves'. But there have been changes to the reserves over the years.Sukumar said wildlife managers have to first do a through assessment of the elephant reserves. They must then formulate a proper management plan to improve the habitat. Only then can the elephants be contained within the forest areas, he added."]
