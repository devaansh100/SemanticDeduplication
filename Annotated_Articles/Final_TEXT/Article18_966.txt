['Viral video: Alpaca spotted running loose on streets of England\nStock image of a Peruvian alpaca Photo : iStock Bizarre incidents occur on the streets everyday - from people dressed as dinosaurs running frantically to a dog that looks like a giant spider scaring the daylights out of every pedestrian. Thanks to dashcams , some even more unusual activities have come to light. But, what’s the wildest thing (literally) you can imagine running into a suburb? Sharing the clip on Instagram, a local meme page stated that a “llama” was running on Soho Road , near Bobby’s Punjabi Food Corner, according to a report by Birmingham Mail “Llama on Soho Road looking for Johnny Depp !," the caption read, jokingly referring to the Pirates of the Caribbean actor’s recent visit to the city last week. The person filming the video can be heard yelling, "What\'s a llama doing running on the road?" Another clip in the same video shows an unflinching man snapping his finger and clapping in an attempt to guide the farmyard animal to safety. While they got the location right, it was a classic case of misidentification as the big fella on the loose is actually an alpaca, a member of the same animal family but smaller. It is said that the animal had escaped from a school down the road. “They were there for show and tell,” an Instagram user informed. However, it remains unclear where the alpaca took off from and whether it was safely relocated.']
