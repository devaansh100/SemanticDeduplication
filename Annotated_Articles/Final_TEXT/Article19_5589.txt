In the disturbing video, three men are seen patting a street dog as they tie a string of crackers to its tail. The three men are seeing laughing as the crackers start lighting up the dog is seen helplessly trying to run away from it. While many posts on social media were shared stating the incident had taken place in BTM Layout in Bengaluru, police said the incident actually took place in Shivamogga district. Speaking to TNM, Mico Layout police confirmed that the incident did not take place in their jurisdictional limits and said the bike was traced to Bhadravathi. The accused have been identified as Bharath, Mithun and Nithin, all of whom are between 19-21 years of age. Officials at the Bhadravathi Rural Police Station said the accused have been booked under sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and have been questioned. A police official said, “The incident occurred on October 26 in Singamane village, Bhadravathi. It is a non-cognisable offence and we will file a charge sheet after the investigations are over.” The incident has also brought the issue of the archaic British era law which does not give police nor the courts any teeth to punish offenders who are cruel to animals. As per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 the punishment for animal cruelty is not severe. In most cases, the accused are imposed upon a fine of an amount between Rs 50 and Rs 100 and are let go without any actual punishments. Animal rights activists have time and again fought for stringent punishment against animal cruelty and attributed the cause of growing apathy towards stray animals to the lax punishments as the accused are not scared about the consequences of causing physical harm to animals. Activists in Bengaluru said that they will meet the state police chief on the issue.']
