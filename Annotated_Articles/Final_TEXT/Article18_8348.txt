Mysuru Zoo seems to enjoy their company, in the video a man can be heard speaking about the animal and throwing some pieces of fruits for them. As soon as the fruit lands in their zone, the mother bear seems to smell and verify the food, which is later enjoyed by the two kids. The video also captures the dialogue between to men, probably Zoo officials, who talk of the nutrition and breast feeding abilities of the parent bear.
