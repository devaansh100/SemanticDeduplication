One individual was apprehended, while another fled. Forest and wildlife officers continued their search and interrogation of the detainee in order to learn where the animals came from and where they were going. As Mizoram, Manipur, and other northeastern states are being used as corridors, forest officers in southern Assam have retrieved several rare species smuggled from Myanmar. Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland share a 1,643-kilometer unfenced border with Myanmar. (with inputs from IANS)']
