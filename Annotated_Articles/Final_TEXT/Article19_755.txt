But recently, a massive 36-feet-long humpback whale has been found dead in the Amazon jungle in Brazil, leaving everybody - from experts to commoners - shocked. How could the carcass reach a place which is by no means a habitat for a giant sea mammal? The animal was found around 50 feet away from the nearest sea body.

According to experts, the whale might have died at sea and its carcass was thrown up into the jungle area by rough sea tides. A team from Semma, Brazil, went to the area to inspect the whale's remains. The whale is believed to be a 12-month-old calf. Its body bore no external injury. The Maritime Herald said in a report that the whale might have been killed by consuming marine plastics and then the carcass was washed ashore into the jungle.
