They have been handed over to the forest department for their conservation, said police.According to a belief, if an owl is sacrificed in a house during Lakshmi puja, the goddess will be forced to “stay” with the family.“Owls are not only sacrificed, but talismans containing parts like talons and bones of the bird are also sold at a high price. They are also used in black magic. The accused were on their way to deliver the bird to a person. We are trying to gather information about the second party,” said SP Manish Kumar Mishra.“In most cases the owls are delivered to the client’s doorstep and the owls cannot be rescued since they are sacrificed,” police added.According to wildlife activists, Agra is one of the major hubs of illegal owl trade.']
