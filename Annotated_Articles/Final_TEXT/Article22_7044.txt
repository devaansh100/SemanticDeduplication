The family thought the pet had vanished during electrical work taking place on the house in 1982. Three decades later, the family found Manuela in a box with an old wooden speaker inside. "We were shocked! My mom arrived crying because she didn\'t believe it - they found Manuela!" Nathalye said in 2013. Manuela had managed to survive more than three decades locked inside the storage box. It was thought that it had managed to survive from eating termite larvae, which were also found in the room. Ten years later, Manuela is still alive - but is now called Manuel, as it turned out during a routine veterinary check-up this year that the tortoise is actually male. A tortoise can live up to 255 years old and can survive for about three years without food and water. The world\'s oldest tortoise is called Jonathan - a Seychelles giant tortoise, currently living on the South Atlantic Island of St Helena.']
