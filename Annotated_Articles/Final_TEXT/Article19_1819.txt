The passenger, an Algerian national was arrested as the result of a joint operation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Around 3 am on March 27, Algerian national Abdelouahab Bouaziz arrived at IGI airport's terminal 3 to board a flight to Doha. Security personnel noticed the bag as Bouaziz was headed for baggage check. Despite repeated inquiries, the Algerian national claimed that he bought the bag in Algeria but failed to produce a receipt for the same. This prompted CISF personnel to alert customs officials who arrived at the scene and took custody of Bouaziz and his bag. (Monitor Lizard) Soon, a team comprising CBI sleuths and wildlife officials arrived at IGI. They confirmed that the bag was made of monitor lizard's skin. The assistant inspector general of CISF, Hemendra Singh confirmed Bouaziz's arrest to media outlets, however, CBI officials refused to comment on the incident. Meanwhile, an official with WCCB said that the offense carries a punishment of not less than three years in jail and a maximum sentence of seven years since the monitor lizard is a protected species in India. He further added that a monetary fine of up to Rs 25,000 can be slapped on repeat offenders in this regard, over and above the jail term. Known as Varanus bengalensis, the monitor lizard is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Since Varanus which is a family of monitor lizards are highly endangered and strictly protected, at least two species of these lizards fall under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972."]
