Just like this one video of a cute little monkey that has gone massively viral on Instagram ever since it has been posted a few days ago. The video opens to show a baby monkey sitting on the ground in an outdoor setting. The cute creature keeps sucking its thumb and keeps looking intently at the dragon fruit that its human was holding out to it. The human cuts the fruit into a slice that the baby monkey can hold but it still doesn't really understand what to do with it in the cutest way possible. The human then proceeds to take a bite out of this slice of dragon fruit so that the baby monkey can copy this action and eat it as well. The cute monkey, of course, understands that and picks up the fruit and proceeds to eat it. The original video was shot by an Instagram user named Adi Dwi whose baby monkey is named Nunuk.
