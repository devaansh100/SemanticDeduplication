They get confused as they see the sky in the reflective glass. Surat lies in the rosy starlings’ migration path and the birds must be staying in the city for a few days.”“It is an unfortunate incident and we will ensure that it is not repeated. It is an eastern European bird that migrates to India during winter. I am coming across such an incident for the first time,” said Puneet Nayyar , deputy conservator of forest, Surat."]
