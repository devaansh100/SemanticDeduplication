The incident took place in the Gattubuthkur village of the Karimnagar district. The well did not have a lot of water in it and was surrounded by plants. According to the forest officials, the overgrown plants inside the well acted as cushions and prevented the cubs from drowning. The forest department used three ladders and nets to enter the well. The officials stated that the bear cubs were released into a nearby forest after being fed properly. The mother of the cubs was also spotted frequenting the surrounding area. While talking to the News Minute, T Srinivas, Karimnagar Forest Range Officer said that they fed the bears with some fruits after rescuing them. He also stated that the bears were kept under a tree for some time after being rescued. The bear cubs were released in the direction from where their mother was calling out to them. The officials alleged that they found pug marks of the bear. Earlier this month, a sloth bear had attacked villagers and a herd of cattle in Telangana's Jayashankar Bhupalpally district. The bear initially attacked the cattle and when the villagers tried to ward it off, the animal attacked them. The animal allegedly ripped off the skin of a local, causing serious injury on his skull. The villagers eventually managed to scare the bear. The victim was taken to a hospital and was admitted to the ICU. The doctors revealed that some pieces of the skull had been embedded in the victim's brain and needed surgery."]
