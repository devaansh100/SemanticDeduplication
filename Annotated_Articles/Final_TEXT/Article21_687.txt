Forest officials seized its decomposed carcass and took it for post-mortem. The incident may have occurred five days back but came to the light Saturday after locals noticed the dead pachyderm and informed forest officials. Electric wires and a bottle were seized from the spot Sources said Khamar forest range is a natural habitat for scores of elephants. It is suspected that the elephant was trapped into the live wire laid by poachers to kill the pachyderms for their ivories. Locals alleged poaching of wildlife is on the rise in the area due to negligence of forest officials and members of the elephant squad. Khamar ranger Chandrasekhar Gadnayak said efforts are on to nab the accused. Deogarh DFO Khyama Sarangi said the tusker was separated from the herd and was roaming alone in the forest. The DFO said action will be taken if charges of negligence are proved against the forest officials. Further investigation is on to ascertain the cause behind the elephantâ€™s death. PNN']
