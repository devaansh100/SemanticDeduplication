Poacher held with coots at Nalsarovar
AHMEDABAD: While wintering migratory birds may just have started to arrive at Nalsarovar, poachers seems to be making their way to the lake. On Friday night , forest department staff arrested one Lakshman Dethala, a resident of Nani Kathechi village Brijesh Chaudhary, deputy conservator of forests, Nalsarovar, said, that while staffers were patrolling they intercepted Laxman with the two birds. The birds were alive and their wings and legs were intact and they were thus released immediately. He said Laxman was produced in a Limbdi court and was remanded in custody for two days. A senior officer said that this was the second such incident in less than a fortnight and the third incident since January. Earlier, one person was arrested with 16 birds. He said it was surprising that the person had not caused any injury to the birds. Poachers usually clip their wings or even twist their legs to make sure they canâ€™t fly.The officer said poaching is an old activity at the lake and it was thus decided that teams carry out patrolling at the night in nearby villages and too so such activity could be detected. In January, two persons including a women were caught poaching.
