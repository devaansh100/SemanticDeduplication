The birds were found dead on Sunday morning, but forest officials kept the matter under wraps for more than 24 hours.“Perhaps this may be due to the back-to-back poisoning incidents.

The birds were found dead on a dry lake bed surrounded by forest from all sides.“Post mortem report also confirmed that the birds died due to poisoning. No arrests have been made till now and we are searching for the culprits, who may be habitual offenders,” said Arjuna.RFO SB Dange said, “We will catch the culprits soon. A preliminary offence report (POR) has been registered against unidentified men. This is the first such incident that has come to light.”']
