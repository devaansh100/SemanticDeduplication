(Photo: Reuters) By Nagarjun Dwarakanath: The forest department in Karnataka has started a massive hunt to catch a tiger in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve that allegedly killed two people recently. Speaking to India Today TV, Director Bandipur Tiger Reserve T Balachandra said they are using elephants to search the tiger. "Teams have been formed and we are trying to spot it. We will tranquilize the animal and take it to safety," he said. advertisement Shafat Ali Khan, the infamous hunter from Maharashtra who killed tigress Avni last year, triggering a massive uproar, had reportedly volunteered to "kill" this tiger. However, the forest department turned down his offer and sent him back saying their own vets will tranquilize the animal. The tiger is reported to have killed two people and 14 cattle in Chamrajnagar district of Karnataka. The Bandipur Tiger Reserve is an 872 square km forest, situated about 220km southwest of Bengaluru on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. Shooting the tiger, however, will be a last resort if the search party is unable to tranquilize and immobilize it on sighting. "Our priority is to tranquilise the tiger as there is no order to shoot. We are not in a hurry to shoot it but to capture it alive," said Balachandra. The forest guards have installed an additional 100 camera traps by evening when the hunt was suspended for the day. The hunt party plans to install 50-60 more camera traps on Thursday in the wild reserve where the feline is on the prowl. "We have reinforced the hunt with three more elephants and two veterinary doctors joining the search team," the official said. "Shortage of tranquilizers and veterinary doctors is hampering our efforts to sight and neutralize the tiger at the earliest and before it attacks a human than other wildlife animals," Balachandra said. The affected people dwelling in the forest are not insisting on killing the tiger but capturing and relocating it in the wild. Camera traps have shown the tiger was healthy and prowling around well. "Forest guards have been seeing pub marks daily of the elusive big cat, which is reported to have killed at least 14 cattle over the last two months," Balachandra added. (With inputs from IANS.)
