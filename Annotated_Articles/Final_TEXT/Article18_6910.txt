['11 members of gang held in leopard skin trade case\nNashik: The Shahapur forest department has arrested 11 members of a gang, some of them from Nashik , for their alleged involvement in the sale of leopard skins.The arrest came after the department sent two persons including one staff member, as decoy customers. They travelled to Nashik on February 2 to buy a leopard skin after striking a deal at Rs 7 lakh with the suspect.One person was immediately arrested after he produced the animal skin.Deputy commissioner of forest of Shahapur, V T Ghule, said they were carrying further investigation in the case. “We apprehend that the arrested accused are a part of a big gang involved in the illegal sale of animal skin. We have arrested the person, who had the leopard skin. He has claimed that the animal was dead,” added Ghule.He added that the leopard, whose skin was being sold, was from Nashik. There is a presence of leopards in rural Nashik, especially in the Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar and Sinnar areas. Prakash Ramchandra Chaudhari , the Shahapur range forest officer (RFO), who led the entire operation, told TOI that the department had received a tip-off early last month about the illegal sale of leopard skin.“While investigating the case, we found out that some members of the gang are active in he Nashik and Thane regions. One member of the cell does not know the identity of most members of the gang. The interactions take place only on cellphones,” added the RFO.The forest investigating team managed to get the contact number of one of the main members of the gang and after repeated persuasion over days, the latter agreed to sell the leopard skin.Chaudhari, along with another person, visited Nashik on February 2 as decoy customer. At Sinnar-Ghoti road, the suspect showed them the leopard skin and demanded the money before he handed it over.“We immediately arrested him and based on his statement, we arrested six more people, who were part of the gang. Later, we made four more arrests,” added Chaudhari.Shahapur forest department sources said that the probe would be widened to unearth other members of gang. “Our apprehension is that this gang may be involved in the illegal trade for quite some time. We will question them to find out more details on the issue,” added Chaudhari.']
