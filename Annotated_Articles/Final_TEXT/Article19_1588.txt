['SRPF constable arrested by Maharashtra forest department for trading red sand boa\nThe red sand boa is one of the most sought after snake species in illegal wildlife trade and keeping it as a pet is illegal. As per Darshan Thakur, Range Forest Officer (RFO), Khardi, he had received a tipoff about a person, who was trying to sell off a red sand boa snake. A constable attached with the Maharashtra State Reserved Police Force (SRPF) was arrested under sections of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, on Sunday, for allegedly trying to trade a red sand boa snake in exchange of a hefty amount. The reason behind this huge amount is the belief that the snake can bring good luck and wealth. Also, a great demand for it in the illegal market is driven by the myth of it having supernatural healing powers with regard to cancer, HIV/AIDS," said a conservationist, who works on exposing such illegal wildlife traders.']
