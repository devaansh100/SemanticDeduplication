["Snake Found On Flight From Kuala Lumpur\nImagine your worst nightmare involving snakes coming to life, then double it. This flight from Kuala Lumpur sure had passengers feeling this way after a snake was found hanging out in the illuminated area of the plane. The Air Asia Airbus A320-200 was headed to Tawau, Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur. The short clip was originally tweeted by Hana Mohsin Khan, a commercial pilot. It's unclear whether she was manning said flight. Yikes! Snake on a plane! Either an escaped pet from passenger carry on/luggage or possibly climbed its way into the aircraft from the ground.
