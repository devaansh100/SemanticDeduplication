The DFO said that forest employees, including range officers of nearby ranges, were sent to the spot. Besides, staff and two elephants were pressed into service to push back the angry leopard towards the forest. The DFO said that the team succeeded in luring the leopard away from the village. However, several people working in the fields tried to surround the big cat. Surrounded by crowds, the leopardess injured three more people in an attempt to escape. In the meantime, a large number of villagers gathered at the spot and killed the leopardess with sticks and rods. As it is, the immediate family members of the injured and the villagers were angry at the forest departmentâ€™s inability to protect them. When forest officials tried to save the leopardess from their wrath, the incensed villagers turned their ire on the forest officials. The villagers, including women, pelted stones on the vehicles of the forest department. They also took one Moharram Ali, a mahout, hostage and pelted stones at range officer Nishangara Tara Shankar Yadav, who sustained minor head injuries.
