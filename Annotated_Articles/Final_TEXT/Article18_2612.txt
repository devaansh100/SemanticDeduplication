I was loaded down from a range trip when I was ambushed. So here is the video of them all in. I wish I would have been in my truck but I was stuck in the gas saver. This model didn’t come with the kitten box either. I couldn’t keep up with them as I would throw one in and 2 would jump out. So I had to close the door with the window down and funnel em in. That would have been good footage actually”, he captioned the video. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Robert Brantley (@robertbrantley_)']
