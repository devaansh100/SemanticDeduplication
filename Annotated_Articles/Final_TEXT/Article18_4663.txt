The caption of the video reads "Mother leopard Olimba proves her ability as a skilled hunter as she stalks a troop of baboons." In this video going viral, it can be seen that Leopard sees a herd of Baboon sitting on the ground and it very cleverly approaches the group of Baboon, looking for the right opportunity to hunt. Leopard attacks the baboon swarm as soon as it gets the right opportunity and one of the baby baboons is separated from the group. The leopard hunts the separated baboon from the herd before climbing the tree because if the baboon climbed the tree, it would be difficult for the leopard to hunt it and due to the distance of the tree, the baboon could not reach there. And in the end, becomes the victim of the leopard. At the end of the video, the baboon family revolves around Leopard so that Leopard can leave their baby and survive, but Leopard has already killed the baboon.']
