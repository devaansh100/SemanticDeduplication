['Wild elephant charges towards bus, driver gets plaudits for maintaining his cool\nDriving a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus through the twisting Munnar roads turned out to be more adventurous for a bus driver than he would have imagined. The driver had to not only manoeuvre the vehicle through the mountainous range, but also deal with a wild elephant. A video of a wild elephant charging towards the bus has surfaced online. The clip shows the elephant standing on the road as people inside the bus are heard panicking. The wild elephant comes towards the bus and charges at the windshield, cracking it a bit. The driver, however, doesn’t lose his cool. As the pachyderm retracts and moves aside, the driver promptly accelerates and rides to safety.
