They waited till the visitors left and between 7.30pm and 8.30 pm cut the wires of the monkeys' cage, where there was no CCTV, and put the animals in a backpack with holes in it for ventilation.On Sathyavel's instructions Janakiraman, to avoid cameras and watchmen, carried the backpack through a bamboo thicket to the elephant park, when the elephants were chained for the night. He then climbed a tree near the six-foot compound wall and jumped over to the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road where Sathyavel was waiting on a bike. They went to pet trader Vinoth and sold the monkeys for 4 lakh. Tambaram police commissioner M Ravi deputed a team led by deputy commissioner Sibi Chakravarthy to investigate. Police zeroed in Sathyavel as CCTV camera footage at the gate showed him handing a backpack to a visitor entering the zoo.On checking CCTV footage from the zoo, police zeroed in on Sathyavel as he was spotted handing over a bag to a visitor.Meanwhile, Vinoth had kept the monkeys in a fruit basket at his house and showed them to his friends, claiming to have got them from a friend abroad.Police said they could rescue the animals as Vinoth could not offer them for sale immediately as news of the squirrel monkeys going missing from the zoo had spread.The two male monkeys had been handed over to the zoo on July 22, 2020, by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Chennai, which had seized them in a raid. Deputy director of the zoo R Kanchana said the squirrel monkeys were being kept in an enclosure now and would be rehabilitated in the zoo once the case was over.S Sathyavel, D Janakiraman , Vinoth, 29, and a mutual acquaintance, Loganathan, 21, were arrested."]
