Screenshots from the video posted on Twitter by RobC By India Today Web Desk: A spine-chilling video of a tiger pouncing upon a 7-year-old boy is doing rounds on the internet. The incident took place at Dublin Zoo in Ireland. In the video, the boy can be seen posing for camera against the glass wall of the enclosed area where the tiger was held. As the boy posed, the tiger can be seen moving slyly towards him. The perfect photo op took a horrific turn when the tiger pounced upon the glass to attack the little boy. advertisement Though the boy was safe because of the glass wall against which the tiger pawed upon, the little child could have been on the tiger\'s menu. The boy\'s father, Rob, took to Twitter to share the terrifying clip on December 23. "My son was on the menu in Dublin Zoo today #raar," he wrote.

Going by his loud laughter in the end of the video, it seems like he had already anticipated what was about to come. In a conversation with Storyful, Rob revealed that his son reacted pretty calmly and ran very fast after the tiger almost attacked him. The scary video received many reactions from the netizens. A user called the clip "terrifying and amazing all in one." "Scary stuff. Hope the boy wasn\'t traumatised! In a way it\'s good to know that living in the zoo hasn\'t affected its natural instinct," commented another user.

Couldnâ€™t even see the tiger when we went Andrew Dyer (@andrewdyer92) December 23, 2019 Saw a snow leopard do this very thing at the Bronx Zoo decades ago. Any nearby youngster is viewed as an item on the menu by the big cats. Marianne G. Petrino (@NineTiger) December 23, 2019 Wow Auntie Septic OhMyDays (@SepticSj) December 23, 2019 Fascinating how it stops stalking when it realizes it\'s been "caught" and speeds up to "take the opportunity while his back is turned" fortunately he\'s safe behind class of which the big cat has no understanding of. Fandomguy (@SUFANbowserjr) December 23, 2019 Brilliant to see this, worked in zoo years ago and seen this a few times . Jago (@Jaganator16) December 22, 2019 Now that was truly a frightening video!
