The parakeets were concealed in milk cartons.The birds were rescued after a passenger on board the train heard their sound and alerted the Delhi forest department and railway authorities. “Following directions from the chief wildlife warden and Delhi’s wildlife officer, the parakeets were rescued by the railway police and wildlife authorities at the railway station,” said an official. The birds were later handed over to Wildlife SOS, an NGO, for treatment.The delicate baby birds were crammed into milk cartons to avoid suspicion and detection. “They will be freed into their natural habitat after they are fit for release,” said Geeta Seshamani, secretary at Wildlife SOS.Despite being listed as a “near threatened” species, Alexandrine parakeet (Psittaculla eupatria) is one of the most sought after species in the Indian live bird trade. Parakeets that are 3-4 weeks old are captured from the wild and are crammed into tiny containers and transported to bird markets in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Patna, Lucknow and Kolkata. In most cases, the birds die en route due to stressful conditions.“It was heartening to see a quick response from the authorities concerned to seize the live birds from the railway station,” said Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS.']
