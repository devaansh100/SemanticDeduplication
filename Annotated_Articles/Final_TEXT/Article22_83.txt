['Wolf-Garten 170-300cm: Wolf Garten ZMV3 Multi-Change Telescopic Handle Extends from 170\nI bought this to replace one that I had bought in a garden centre and lost during a house move . I didn’t pay much attention to size abs weight as I loved my old one . I used it with a variety of heads . This one is far too heavy . I might use it with the rake head I bought but nothing smaller , it’s just too cumbersome ( even for me at 5’09”) Maybe if I hadn’t been expecting it to be as lightweight as my last one I might not be so disappointed but it’s just turned out to be a “bad buy”']
