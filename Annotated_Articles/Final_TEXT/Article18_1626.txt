['Tiger, cubs kill 2 more in 24 hrs, 4th death in 1 wk\nBareilly : After 19 human kills and a brief lull, a tigress and her sub-adult cubs have struck again, twice, in the past 24 hours. Their latest victims were two farmers, both in their 40s. Monday’s killings have spread terror among residents living around the Singahi range which falls within the buffer range of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve . Since 2020, 21 human deaths have been reported from the region so far, with four cases in the past week alone, officials said.Dudhwa field director Sanjay Pathak told TOI on Monday, “Our team had sighted the tigress, only for a few seconds, near Kharetiya village. We appealed to local residents to remain indoors and move in groups, that too only if necessary. Some of them ignored our repeated warnings which led to these fresh incidents.” A forest official said there is a possibility that two sub-adult cubs of the tigress may be also responsible for the attacks on humans.']
