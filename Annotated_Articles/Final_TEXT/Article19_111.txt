It could be confirmed after postmortem,” said a senior forest official.The discovery of the carcass has diverted attention of the Udumalpet range forest personnel who had been busy in the past few days monitoring crop-raiding elephant Chinna Thambi, which was roaming in Madathukulam area near Udumalpet.']
