However, it appears that the animals have adapted as well, and they know where to go when they are hurt. A recent example comes from Bihar, when a doctor was astonished to see a monkey and its baby arrive at his chamber for treatment. The video of the touching moment has gone viral on the internet. The incident occurred in Sasaram, Bihar’s Rohtas district headquarters. The monkey had come in to have its wounds treated, and it had caught everyone off guard. The doctor quickly responded by tending to the monkey. He treated it, and it then peacefully left the location without causing any harm to people or the environment. On social media, a video of the doctor bandaging the monkey’s wounds has gone viral. The caption read, read, “Sasaram mai ek bandar apne bacho ke sath apna ilaj karvane pahucha. Ilaj karne wale doctor SM Ahmed khud ko saubhagyashali mante hai ki Hanuman Ji khud unke paas aaye (In Sasaram, a monkey reached a private hospital with his child to get himself treated. Doctor SM Ahmed, who treated the monkey, considers himself fortunate that Hanuman ji himself came to him)” सासाराम में जब एक बंदर अपने बच्चे के साथ खुद का इलाज़ करवाने पहुंचा निजी अस्पताल। इलाज़ करने वाले डॉक्टर एस एम अहमद खुद को सौभाग्यशाली समझ रहे है की हनुमान जी खुद चलकर इनके पास पहुंचे pic.twitter.com/0NPrAtV6NU — rajeshkumarojha (@rajeshrepoter) June 8, 2022 Ahmad was in his own clinic, which is located in the town’s Shahzuma neighbourhood. Suddenly, he noticed a female monkey with a small baby clinging to its chest entering his clinic. The monkey entered the room and sat quietly on the bed, displaying the wounds on its body. The doctor went to work right away. He treated the wounds with ointment and wrapped them in a bandage. As soon as word got out in town, people flocked to the clinic to see what had happened. Local residents recorded the entire scenario while the doctor was treating the simian, and the videos have now gone viral. The monkey and its infant departed the area after receiving medical assistance.']
