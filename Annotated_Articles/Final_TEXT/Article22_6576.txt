Buy Now | Our best subscription plan now has a special price The Great Indian Hornbill, a member of the hornbill family, is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Since the species is declining in numbers and its distribution is fragmented, it was listed as ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2018. The vulnerable (VU) category lists those species which possess a very high risk of global extinction. According to IUCN, forest loss has had a detrimental impact on this species throughout its range as the Great Indian Hornbill shows a preference for forest areas with large trees. ‚ÄúBecause of its exceptionally large home range, the species requires extensive tracts of undisturbed forest and is unable to persist in areas where lowland forest has been reduced to small fragments,‚Äù it stated.

In many tribal cultures, its meat, feathers and casque are also used for ornamental purposes. üì£ For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and don‚Äôt miss out on the latest updates!']
