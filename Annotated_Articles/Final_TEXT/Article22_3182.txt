It was trapped by the forest officials after a week’s operation.Dharwad district is spread across 4,273 lakh hectares and only 8.24 per cent of has forest cover.While half of the district is plain land, the remaining is adjacent to the Western Ghats where leopards, deer, civet cats and various types of reptiles have their natural habitats. Migratory birds from different parts of the world are regular guests to the region.DCF Yashpal said the straying of wild animals into urban areas was not because their population was increasing, but because their habitats have been disturbed by construction of roads and railway lines. He said construction of roads in animal habitat should be minimal and should not obstruct their movement for food and water.Cases of elephant herds straying into human habitat are increasing and the rock python is on the verge of extinction here.Environmentalist Harsha Sheelavant said there is need to understand the importance of preserving buffer zones along with core areas for small forest patches around cities.He said community involvement is not at all appreciated by the forest department. “They can't have their plans implemented in isolation without the cooperation of local communities. In Mumbai, people have started respecting leopards by switching off streetlights and have created food and water pickets under bridges. Underpasses have reduced the road killings substantially during night time. Let us respect their right to live,” he said."]
