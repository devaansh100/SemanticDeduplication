['Cow sent to jail for killing 12-year-old child, along with owner arrested\nQuoting the police statement, the Independent reported that the cow was roaming near a field in the evening last week, when it attacked the child, killing him instantly. When this incident happened, the animal was pulling the plow in the Lake State. Police spokesman, Major Eliza Mabor said, “The bull has now been arrested at a police station in Rumbeck Central County. The boy was taken to a hospital for a post-mortem and sent home for burial.” However, this is not the first time that an animal has been arrested in the country. Last month, a sheep was arrested in connection with the murder. Sheep was alleged to have hit a 45-year-old woman, leading to her death. Adieu Chapping, 45, was repeatedly hit by a sheep. Due to this his ribs were damaged. On the arrest of the sheep, the police had said that the owner of the sheep is innocent, but the animal has committed a crime, which warrants its arrest. As a Pulit, it is our duty to provide security to our citizens. Last week the sheep were sent to a military camp for three years. Hard labor will be made from him here. It is expected to be given to Chapping’s family in accordance with the laws and traditions of the country. It has been said in many reports that if an animal kills a person, then after the completion of its sentence, it is given to the victim’s family as compensation. The Independent reported that any pet that kills a person is automatically given as compensation to the victim’s family after serving the sentence. A local court had also fined sheep owner Duoni Manyang Dhal, five cows, and the victim’s family would have to surrender.
