Four persons split into two groups were intercepted by waiting forest personnel at Kollegal and Gundal area in Hanur and nabbed them with wild animal parts.

The names of the culprit have been identified as Mahadev (28), Kumar (20), Mahadev (22) and Rangaswamy (23), all residents of Hanur taluk of Chamarajanagar district and belonging to Soliga, a tribal community. According to Yedukondalu, Mahadeva and Rangaswamy are brothers. While the police were able to recover tiger parts from the duo, skin and canine tooth from the tiger were already sold to persons. However, there was no immediate information available on the value fixed by tribal men for the wild animal parts. The DCF said that these men were into animal part trading since quite some time and said that they will be produced before the Court in order to seek their custody for interrogation to gather more details on the trade conducted by them.']
