Stitched inside nylon bags, the Mute Swans were barely alive. They have been handed over to the forest department in Nadia.“In India, it is illegal to keep these birds as pets. On Friday, troops of the 08Bn BSF, posted at BOP Mahendara, reacted to an intelligence input and laid an ambush. Some people were seen moving towards the border with bags. On being challenged, they dropped the bags and disappeared into some dense bamboo grooves towards Bangladesh. The bags were cut open to free the birds that were in a bad shape,” said a senior BSF official.']
