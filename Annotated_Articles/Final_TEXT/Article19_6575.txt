Give Reasons for Your Answer. - English\nThe tiger shooting organised by the villagers was a serious affair because Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without taking much risk. A neighbouring village was chosen for the game killing. The idea of earning a thousand rupees had egged on the villagers. They had posted their children at the borders of the local jungle to head the tiger back to the village so that it may not go to some fresh hunting grounds. Mrs. Packletide was compelled to do this as the idea of her friend Loona Bimberton boasting of her personally procuring a tiger-skin and popularity of the press photographs could not be digested. Mrs. Packletides movements and motives were largely governed by the dislike of â€˜ Loona Bimberton. Cheaper kind of goats were left about in a great number to keep the tiger satisfied. All precautions were taken so as not to drive the tiger away. A platform was constructed in a conveniently placed tree. Mis. Packletide even paid her companion Miss Mebbin to accompany her to the shoot. For the villagers it seemed to be a serious affair for as soon as the rifle flashed and the beast rolled over dead, a crowd of excited natives came to the place shouting happily and carried the news to the village. They were anxious for their thousand rupees. Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light and a happy heart.']
