These marine creatures have declined by 30 to 50 percent in population according to data by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. Some of the major threats to their population include global warming, increased demand for turtle meat and eggs, plastic pollution, and bycatch in fishing gear. In India, three mass nesting sites of these turtles are present in Odisha and one in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. What are your thoughts on the video?
