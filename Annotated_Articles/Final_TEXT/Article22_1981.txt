['Cobra Snake Cane Walking Stick : Amazon.in: Health & Personal Care\n5.0 out of 5 stars Nag for a Guru Reviewed in the United States on 30 March 2021 This cane is perfect. I am still very much working on letting go of my fashion accessory attachment. I am using the excuse that I am paralyzed in several muscles in my legs, and since I am required to use a cane, I wanted a fancy nice one. But that excuse is obvious as I don’t “need” a cobra cane. However, I will bless it and utilize it as my protective Nag, just like our Lord Shiva.  No blade, but that is good. These blades are not legal in many places and are screw in blades. Should you ever try to use it, it would potentially break and cut or stab you. It is better that it doesn’t have a blade. Violence is never okay.']
