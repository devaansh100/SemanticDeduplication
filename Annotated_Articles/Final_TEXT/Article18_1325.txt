['13 dead chinkaras found near Jaisalmer solar co over 2 days\nJAISALMER: Two days after seven chinkaras were killed by stray dogs near the boundary wall of an under-construction solar power firm, the remains of six more chinkaras were recovered in the same area under Sankara police station in Jaisalmer district on Wednesday.Sources said the severed heads of four chinkaras and the mutilated bodies of two others were found close to the boundary wall of Eden Renewable Private Limited. It is suspected that these chinkaras were also killed by stray dogs. The boundary wall of the firm prevented the chinkaras from running away to save their lives from the dogs. These incidents have created resentment among wildlife enthusiasts and the local villagers who allege that the solar companies have made the wildlife in the area vulnerable by recklessly felling trees.After learning of the latest deaths, forest department officials led by the DFO visited the site and took the bodies in possession. Wildlife enthusiast Radheshyam Pemani and Sumer Singh Sanwata , who also visited the site, said the chinkaras had come there in search of water and had been trapped there. The wildlife enthusiasts were not permitted to enter solar power companyâ€™s premises for an inspection. The wildlife enthusiasts said the habitat of the local wildlife has been ruined by these companies, due to which these animals are forced to roam here and there in search of water. They said they would soon file a case against the solar power companies in this connection.']
