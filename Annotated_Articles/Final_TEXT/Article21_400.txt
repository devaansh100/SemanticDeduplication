The illegal trade came to light after the district forest officer S Shantaram received a tip-off from an informer in Bihar.“We got a call from a reliable source that a person had put the pangolin scales for sale on social media. On receiving this information and a contact number, we immediately decided to conduct an undercover operation to arrest the accused. Our team was able to locate one of the poachers within a short period of time but it took us about four to five days to complete the entire operation,” said Shantaram.After receiving orders from the DFO, a 10-member team of the forest department headed by forest range officer B Purnima took part in the undercover operation.“We were just given one phone number to investigate the case. We posed as potential buyers and negotiated the price for 35 scales which the accused were planning to sell. After several phone calls, price negotiations to gain their trust and finalizing a place to meet, we were able to nab three persons on the national highway near Rebenna mandal,” said Purnima.Out of six people who came to the location on motor bikes to sell the scales, the forest officials arrested three persons, while the remaining three escaped. The police and forest offciers, who are on the lookout for three more members, say that the gang might also have links in other states.“We seized 35 scales on the spot and another 205 scales from one of the poacher’s houses in Golleti village. People must remember that Pangolin scales have no proven medicinal value and that it is a punishable offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” the FRO added.Indian pangolins are an endangered species and are given the highest level of protection by including them in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Hunting and trading of is a serious offence and punishable with minimum punishment of seven years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of not less than Rs 5 lakh.']
