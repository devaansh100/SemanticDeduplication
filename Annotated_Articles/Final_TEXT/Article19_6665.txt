['‘Killer’ tusker shifted from Kurumbapatty zoological park\nSALEM: A day after shifting the captive tusker, which killed its mahout recently, to Anamalai Tiger Reserve , the Kurumbapatty zoological park was opened for public on Friday.On Monday, the 68-year-old elephant had gone rogue and trampled its mahout P Kaliappan, 45, to death at the zoological park, which is located on the outskirts of the city. The tusker, named Andal, had also attacked a veterinary doctor, who escaped with injuries. The park was subsequently closed for the public. “As Andal was unwell, veterinarian Prakash was deployed to check the animal. During the check-up, it suddenly trampled Kaliappan to death and attacked the doctor. We had to tranquilize the elephant to recover the mahout’s body,” an official, who didn’t want to be named, said.It is to be noted that Andal was brought to the Kurumbapatty zoological park after it trampled three people at the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai in 2009. At the park, the elephant had killed a forest watcher in 2013.A Periyasamy, district forest officer, said, “The elephant was shifted to the Anamalai Tiger Reserve for further treatment. Officials there will take care of the elephant.”']
