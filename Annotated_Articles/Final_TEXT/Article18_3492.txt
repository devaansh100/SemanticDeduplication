['Lions Try To Attack Giraffe, Get Kicked Around By The Giant Mammal\nWhen it comes to nature, the survival of the fittest is the rule. The lion is known as the king of the jungle because it is one of the fiercest predators out there and when it sets its eyes on its prey, it is difficult for the latter to escape. Now, imagine what an entire pride of lions can do to its prey? However, this giraffe gave the pride a run for their... food. Screengrab/Instagram A video on social media is going viral showing the lions attacking a giraffe. Each lion leaps and tries to cling to the giraffe\'s posterior one by one. But the giraffe was in no mood to let them have it their way.  The giraffe first tried to shoo off a pride of lions. As the video goes on, the riled-up giraffe violently kicks away the lions that were trying to jump and claw it from behind. The video ends abruptly and doesn\'t show what happened in the end. The video is shared by wildlife stories on Instagram on Wednesday with the caption: "Strong Giraffe." Since being shared, the video has garnered over twenty million views. People took to comments to praise the brave giraffe. "That\'s like 5 alley cats taking on a man," one user commented.  "That Giraffe is a Problem... Too strong, too Big!! Them kicks hurting them Lions and their Feelings," another user said. "Those missed kicks can actually kill a lion," a third user commented. Another commented, "Giraffe is unlucky not to catch a few lions with those kicks." The lions attacking and preying on giraffes is a rare encounter. This is due to the fact that a lion must seize the neck of its prey in order to dominate it in the traditional manner, which becomes extremely difficult in the case of giraffes.
