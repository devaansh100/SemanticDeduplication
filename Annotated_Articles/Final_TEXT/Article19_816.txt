On the third day of the operation, the officials tranquillised the monkey after it entered an under-construction house on Kanni Kovil Street. The villagers who had fled their houses and taken refuge in temples heaved a sigh of relief. At least 20 people were attacked by the monkey. TV Kaliyamurthy, the village head, requested officials to catch the dogs bitten by the monkey as there are chances of their spreading rabies and requested treatment for the injured.
