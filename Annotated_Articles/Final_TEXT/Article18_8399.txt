Snake Slithering Inside AirAsia Flight Forces Pilot to Divert Plane\nAn AirAsia flight going from Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur to Tawau was diverted after a snake was spotted inside the aircraft. The incident, that took place last week, left the passengers in panic following which the flight was re-routed to Kuching, reported The Star. Air Asia’s chief safety officer Captain Liong Tien Ling, while calling the incident rare in nature, mentioned that it can happen on any flight “from time to time”. Fortunately, no passengers were harmed by the snake that was spotted in an overhead compartment. “AirAsia is aware of the incident that occurred on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Tawau on Thursday. As soon as the captain was aware, he made the decision to divert the aircraft to Kuching as a precautionary measure to fumigate the aircraft,” the chief safety officer was quoted as saying by The Star. A video of the incident was also shared on Twitter. The 10-second clip shows the snake resting inside an illuminated overhead compartment. “Snake on a plane! Either an escaped pet from passenger carry on/luggage or possibly climbed its way into the aircraft from the ground. AirAsia Airbus A320-200,Kuala Lumpur to Tawau. This dude happily stayed inside the illuminated area till plane was diverted,” read the caption of the Twitter video that has nearly 11,000 views.
