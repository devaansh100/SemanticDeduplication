['Adult Tiger Found Dead in Sunderbans, Foresters Suspect Foul\nKolkata: A full-grown Royal Bengal Tiger has been found dead in the Sunderbans in South 24-Parganas district, raising an alarm among forest officials and wildlife conservationists. According to the state forest department sources, the carcass of the tiger was recently spotted at Adalmari forests in the Sunderbans. The carcass had partially decomposed when a forest team on routine patrol detected it. The forest also found a trap near the spot where the carcass was lying. Such traps are usually used to catch deer. This has made senior forest officials suspect that the tiger did not die a natural death. However, at the same time, they are not outright calling it a killing by wildlife poachers as no body parts of the tiger is missing. Usually, poachers decamp with tiger skin, teeth, nail, and the head. Hence, to ascertain the cause of death, the carcass has now been subjected to a post-mortem. Also, forest officials have pressed in local sources to find out who are the people that had laid the trap at the site. The last time an incident of tiger poaching took place in the Sunderbans was in 2008. Since then, there has been not a single poaching reported from the Indian side of the Sunderbans.']
