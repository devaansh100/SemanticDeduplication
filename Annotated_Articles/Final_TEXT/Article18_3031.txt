['\'Nagin Dance\' With Real Cobra At Odisha Wedding Goes Viral\nIndian wedding processions are incomplete without one family member doing the Nagin dance. However, to do so with a live Cobra is something only nightmares are made of. At one such wedding procession, members of a family did exactly that...The result? Well, five of them land in police custody. Screengrab/YouTube The video that has gone viral on social media shows the Baraatis dancing on the streets of Karanjia town in Mayurbhanj district on Wednesday with a snake charmer holding up a cobra in a bamboo basket with its lid open.  At one moment, the snake attempted to the hand of a dancer as revellers danced without an iota of care.   The Odisha Forest Department responded to the scene and rescued the cobra. Five people including the snake charmer were detained for dancing with a highly-venomous reptile. The snake charmer was booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972), and produced in court, which sent him to judicial custody, The Times of India reported. Screengrab/YouTube Snake Helpline convenor Suvendu Mallick said that the snake seemed frightened due to high decibel music played in the procession.  "The snake charmer must have removed the poisonous teeth of the cobra, which is also illegal. I demand strict action against the bride, groom and his father for allowing such a heinous act. This could be one of the first such cases in the country," he said.  Follow us on Telegram. ']
