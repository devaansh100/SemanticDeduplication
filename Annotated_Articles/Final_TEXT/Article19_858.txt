['Forest guard attacked by tiger in Gopalaswamy Betta forest range\nMYSURU: On a day when the forest department managed to net the elusive tiger , which was allegedly responsible for the death of three tribals in a Heggada Devana (HD) Kote hamlet, a guard working for the department was set upon by a wild cat in Hangala village, which comes under the purview of the Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta forest range in Gundlupet taluk, Chamarajanagar on Friday.Forest department officials said that a Hangala resident Mallu spotted a tiger prowling in his farm on Friday morning. Alarmed, he brought the threat to the notice of the Karnataka rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) Hangala president Mahadevappa, who in turn, alerted the forest department about the problem.News of the wild cat freely roaming in the village spread to neighbouring hamlets, and people flocked to Hangala, keen on sighting the tiger.The foresters’ operation to trace the tiger was hindered by the villagers who kept close to their heels. While they tried to ascertain if the big cat had returned to the woods, the tiger pounced on the forest guard Ramu who was leading the group of foresters. Ramu sustained grievous wounds on his right hand. Frightened by, what was in many ways a leaping apparition, the villagers let loose loud cries in panic, which alarmed the tiger sufficiently to retrace its steps back to the forest.Forest department officials rushed the injured Ramu to the taluk hospital in Gundlupet, before shifting him to Mysuru for further treatment.However, the forest department’s failed bid to catch the tiger has plunged the villagers into a state of terror. They are extremely frightened at the prospect of venturing to their farms, and the forest department has stationed personnel around Hangala to deal with any emergency. Veterinarian of Bandipur Tiger Reserve Dr Nagaraj also paid a visit to Hangala to attempt to nab the tiger by tranquillising it.Gundlupet police inspector HN Balakrishna, assistant conservator of forests, Bandipur Ravikumar and range forest officer Puttaswamy are keeping a close watch on the village.']
