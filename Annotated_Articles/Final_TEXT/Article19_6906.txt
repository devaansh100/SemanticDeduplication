['Tarantula Hawk Wasp Carries Off Paralyzed Huntsman Spider For Meal In Australia\nLet’s agree on one thing, a lot of weird things happen in Australia, not only weird, crazy things that scare the living heck out of everyone. In the latest WTF moment that was captured on Cam, an Enormous Hawk Wasp was seen dragging a paralyzed huntsman spider. An image that was shared on Reddit shows the orange spider wasp carting the paralyzed huntsman back to its den. The image was taken in Bronte, Sydney, Australia. The hawk wasp immobilizes their prey with a sting and drags it to its nest. The hawk then lays an egg inside the alive spider which hatches. The larva would then eat it alive from inside out. The image was shared by u/space_monster on r/pics. The image has over 39,000 upvotes and over 3500 comments. Here are some comments that were made on the post on Reddit: dakotaisspiderman said, “Best part about this post? We all knew it was Australia without reading the description. WE JUST KNEW.” S1mba93 said, “Well I just looked up the Huntsman spider and it’s safe to say I won’t ever leave my house anymore because those fuckers seem to be able to live almost anywhere.” A third user said, “I think the best part is knowing its all the way in Australia.. and it can’t hurt us here.” Huntsman Spiders Huntsman spiders are the largest species of spiders that are capable of living in woody places such as furniture and houses. The Huntsman spider is mostly found in the Americas, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. Huntsman spiders are named as huntsman spiders because of their sheer strength, large size, and quick speed that allows them to hunt prey at a lightning-fast speed.']
