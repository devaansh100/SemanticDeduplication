I have had to spend sleepless nights holding flashlights, making sounds and driving the wild boars away,” said farmer Suthari Venkat of Banjarpallypalli in Siddipet district.With the agricultural extension officer of Narayanraopet mandal, T Nagarjun guiding them in how to protect their crops, several farmers have now put up solar fencing with financial assistance being by banks.“The problem of wild boars and monkeys cannot be so easily wished away. I have noticed that farmers suffer huge losses. Solar fencing was a practical thing. Looking at some farmers who adopted it, the others also followed suit and are now assured that their crops can be safe,” Nagarjun said.Asked how safe solar fencing works, Nagarjun said even if the animals came close to the fencing, they could sense a vibration that prevented them from going further.In a pilot project that has been taken up, 84 acres of agricultural land now have protection in the form of solar fencing.Farmers would cultivate vegetables also and bring them to the Bowenpally market in the city to sell their produce.Several farmers had to abandon growing vegetables as the wild boars and monkeys were destroying them. Farmer Venkat was cultivating tomatoes but the entire crop was damaged. He was also growing beans, brinjals and other vegetables.Once he puts up the solar fencing for some more portion of his land, he will resume growing vegetables.Some 30 other farmers have also come and seen his now protected agricultural land.']
