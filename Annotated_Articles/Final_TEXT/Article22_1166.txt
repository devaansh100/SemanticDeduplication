One day they were travelling through a forest. Suddenly they came across a bear. The bear saw them and rushed out upon them. Sheela was good at climbing trees.

She had heard that bears do not harm dead animals. So, she threw herself flat down upon the ground.The bear, coming up to her, put its muzzle close to her ear and sniffed and sniffed. But Jhansi lay very quietly and did not even breathe. At last with a growl it shook its head and went away. Sheela climbed down the tree slowly.
