The 13 parrots were caught at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday, October 15. They came to the attention of security officials while baggage were being scanned, and security personnel spotted graphics of birds inside shoeboxes in a bag. Parakeets from a seller on a road side. REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE BCCL The bag belonged to Anvarjon Rakhmat Jonov but upon being questioned, he resisted and claimed that they were soft toys. The authorities, however, were not fully satisfied with his reply so they opened his bag and checked the boxes, only to find as many as 13 parrots hidden inside them. Most of the birds were found in an unconscious state. The officials further told the court that one of the birds had flown away as the cage was opened but it found its way back on its own.

The court was also informed that it was the first instance of its kind when someone had tried to smuggle live birds from IGI Airport. As is ritual, the Magistrate questioned the 13 victims.
