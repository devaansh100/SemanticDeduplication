The rhino had ventured out of the Kaziranga National Park a few days back and has since been roaming in the villages of Majuli, causing panic among the locals. Currently, the rhino has taken shelter at Kerela Sapori, sending locals into a state of panic and forcing many to abandon their homes, fearing an attack by the huge beast. Meanwhile, a team of forest officials has reached the spot to tranquilise the rhino so that it can be taken back to the forest.

Earlier, in a tragic incident, one person has been killed after a rhino reportedly attacked him in Assam’s Majuli district today. The incident took place on the river island of Samaguri early in the morning, when the man was attacked by the angry beast right in front of his house. The victim, identified as Madan Das, was hospitalised immediately. Later, he succumbed to his injuries. It is to be noted that the rhino had ventured out of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) almost two months ago and was still roaming around the region. However, till date, the forest department has been unsuccessful in driving the rhino back into Kaziranga. WATCH: First Published: 3rd February, 2022 11:44 IST COMMENTS']
