['Tiger movements trigger panic in Prathipadu, Cage Operation on\nKakinada: The residents continue to live in state of fear as the elusive tiger identified as a young male continues to roam in Prathipadu mandal in the Kakinada district. In its latest movement, the tiger attacked and killed a cow on Wednesday night in Vommangi village. The cow was said to tied in the orchard and it belongs to Ramishetti Venkateswara Rao. Forest officials have been trying for the past one week to trace the tiger and capture it. Authorities have found tiger pug marks in the Pandavulapalem Chellayamma Cheruvi, but could not trace the animal. Meanwhile, forest personnel led by DFO IKV Raju, Wildlife DFO Selvam, Sub-DFO Soujanya, Range Officer Srinivasa Rao, Wildlife Ranger Varaprasad, DRO Ramakrishna, and Section Officer Nayak reached the spot and inspected the area. Meanwhile, forest officials said a team of officers with vast experience in diverting tigers was coming to Prathipadu from Srisailam forest to help in Cage Operation to capture the animal. The officials, however, have been monitoring the cage 24x7, and follow standard operating procedures to capture and rescue a tiger safely," Chief Conservator of Forests (CFO) P Ramakrishna said. The young tiger which is said to have strayed into human habitation from Odisha into Gollaprolu has killed six buffaloes so far, and the locals in the surrounding villages of Prathipadu mandal are living in constant fear of the animal.']
