['Three poachers arrested in Keonjhar district, 55kg wild boar flesh seized\nKeonjhar: Forest officials Sunday arrested three poachers from Samakoi area falling within Telkoi Reserve Forest in Keonjhar district. The forest officials seized 55 kilogram wild boar flesh from their possession. The officials conducted the rain acting on a tip-off. The three poachers have been identified as Jitu Mukhi, Purna Munda and Budhu Munda. During interrogation, all confessed to killing the boar through electrocution. They were booked for violating the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the officials said. They also seized the GI wires, glass bottles and nylon ropes that were used in the killing. Poachers often trap boars and spotted deer by spreading galvanized iron wire and nylon ropes in the forest. Some poachers also use trained dogs to kill the animals. Since there is a large population of deer and boar in the forest and they do not get enough food, the animals often stray into nearby villages and fall prey to the poachers. The environmentalist of the area expressed their deep concern over the frequent poaching of the endangered animals which they fear will have a negative effect on bio-diversity. They demanded the forest officials to take disciplinary action so that animal poaching is minimised. PNN']
