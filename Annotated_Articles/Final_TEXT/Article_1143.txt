Nagpur: Melghat wildlife crime cyber cell on Friday busted a major poaching racket being operated in Bhaisdehi in Betul district and seized animal body parts.Four persons have been arrested for their alleged involvement. One of the accused was earlier nailed in a tiger poaching case.According to officials who were part of the operation, the cyber cell was tracking the culprits for the last two months, but due to death of one of the relatives of an accused, trap could not be laid last month.On Friday, in a meticulously planned operation, the culprits could be nabbed with the help of decoys and Madhya Pradesh forest department officials. The accused have reportedly confessed that they were looking for prospective buyers, but denied role in poaching. They said the body parts were removed for preparing traditional medicines after these animals were found dead in the forest.Officials said, “We are not sure whether nails recovered from the accused are of tiger or leopard and only a forensic test can confirm that. The claws seem to be of a sloth bear. We have also seized wild boar jaw. The cyber cell played key role in trailing and nabbing the culprits. Preliminary offence report has been registered by Betul forest officials.”
