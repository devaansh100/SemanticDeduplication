The police in Utrecht, in the Netherlands, found the "sneaky witness" when they were arresting a man for shoplifting. The bird was sitting on the shoulder of the thief. The police took to Instagram to share a photo of the bird placed in a cell. "During the arrest, we found a sneaky witness with feathers and beak on the suspect\'s shoulder. As we don\'t have a birdcage, this bird had no other place to stay than in the cell," the cops wrote. The photo shows that the feathery partner-in-crime was provided with some bread and water by the cops. The little bird was "well cared for".
