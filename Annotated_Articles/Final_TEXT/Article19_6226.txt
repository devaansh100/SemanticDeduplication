The image is not recent and has been circulating for at least since 2015. The caption of the image is also misleading. The caption claims that the snake is found in Africa’s Amazon River. This is false as Amazon River is located in South America not Africa. FACT CHECK: When our team started the investigation, we found that the image is edited and the surface where the snake’s body meets the ground appears distorted. The reverse search image revealed that the image of the snake is that of a normal-sized anaconda on which the surrounding and the men were added. The posts also claim that the reptile is “134 feet long and 2067 kgs.” According to National Geographic, the green anaconda is the world’s largest snake and it can weigh up to 550 kgs – which is far less than what the posts claim. So, the image and the claim about world’s largest snake are untrue. For all the Latest Fact Check News, Download News Nation Android and iOS Mobile Apps.']
