It was shocking to see how these six turtles were living in the dirty water, with floating plastic junk, chemicals and non-consumable food particles which were thrown inside this well,” said the head of PFA Unit-2, Vijay Rangare It took the activists two days to locate all six turtles and rescue them. “Some had chemical paint over their shells and bodies while three of them had visible injuries. After medical examination, we have shifted them to the shelter of Hands That Heal Animal Care Foundation,” he added.The activists, who have also informed the local forest officials, added that these six turtles had been carelessly put inside the well which later became very polluted as no maintenance was carried out. Left stranded inside the well, the turtles were forced to depend on whatever food was thrown inside by those who visited the garden.']
