Three poachers held in Bhitarkanika
KENDRAPADA: Forest officials are on high alert in Bhitarkanika National Park and its neighbouring areas to thwart poaching of spotted deer, wild boars and migratory birds after three poachers were arrested on Friday night for killing a wild boar in the mangrove forests of Gahirmatha.The three poachers have been identified as Jayant Mallick, Tapan Ojha and Alekha Mallick of Ratapanga village. They have confessed that they used wires to kill wild boar as many people organise feasts during January in the villages.“We arrested them while they were carrying the carcass of the wild boar in their vehicle at Nagamatha within Tantiapala-Nandura village,” said Debashis Bhoi, the park’s range officer. “We suspect that they are habitual offenders and involved in many poaching cases in the nearby forest,” he added.The trio have been booked under the Sections-39 and 49 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and Section-27 of Odisha Forest Act. They were produced in the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) at Rajnagar on Saturday. The court rejected their bail petitions, he said.Two weeks back, the forest officials arrested four poachers and seized the carcass of a wild boar from them inside Barunei forest block within the park. Venison and wild boar meat are in high demand during the festive season for which security within the areas has been beefed up. “We are also monitoring the movement of the villagers within the park and its nearby areas,” added the forest officer.The poachers often trap the wild boars and spotted animals by spreading nylon ropes and live wires and kill the animals. Some poachers also use trained dogs to kill the animals. Six years back, the forest officials arrested poachers along with their dogs. The large population of deer and wild boars within Bhitarkanika are not getting sufficient fodder and water inside the park.
