Narmada was playing with her friends near Nakatiya river when the monkeys attacked the children. After hearing their cries for help, locals rushed to the spot and rescued Narmada and others. Her skin was ripped off by the monkeys and she died due to excessive bleeding at the community health centre.Narmada was the youngest of three siblings. Her father, Nand Kishore, a daily wager, said, "There have been cases of monkey bites before but only if one is too close to the simians. In this case, the monkeys were quite aggressive and had bitten my daughter almost everywhere. When I reached the spot, my daughter was crying for help."Ashok Kumar, SHO of Bithri Chenpur police station, said, "The family has been assured compensation under relevant acts. The locals had demanded that the monkeys be trapped. We advised them to take help from the forest department and gram panchayat office. No FIR is possible in this case."There have been multiple cases where monkeys have injured people in Bareilly. Last year, a 35-year-old woman and her three minor children were injured when the roof of their house collapsed as a tribe of monkeys jumped on it in neighbouring Shahjahanpur district.
