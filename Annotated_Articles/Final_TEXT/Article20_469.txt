['Leopard Skin Seized, 5 Poachers Arrested In Mayurbhanj\nMayurbhanj: The sleuths of Rairangpur Forest Division as well as of Manada range have been successful in apprehending five poachers and seizing a leopard skin from their possession while they were trying to sell it. It all happened near Katas village in an interval of one and half months. Earlier also such a racket was busted and leopard skin had also been seized. Acting on a tiff-off, sleuths of Rairangpur Forest Division and Manada range pounced down on the accused while they were busy in the leopard skin sale deal. Sources said that a special team of the forest officials has been on a strict vigil for the past six months to scuttle such modus operandi. The arrested poachers have been identified as Bajinath Hembrum and Sonat Marndi of Bisoi police limits, Khelram Hansdah and Hambir Tudu of Kuliana police limits, and Tusil Murmu of Jamda police limits. Rainrangpur DFO said that they are delving into a thorough investigation and trying to trace out others involved in this illegal trade.']
