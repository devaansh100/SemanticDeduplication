Pigeons will be transported to Tada, Naidupeta and in Gudur divisions through trucks for racing. Then, the birds will be released from there as part of racing and they will reach Trichi. The winner and owner of pigeon will be awarded a cash prize. Usually, the racing will be conducted during winter season, especially in January and February months every year, said the CI. The main accused Philips handed over the pigeons to P Venkatesan, driver of truck. Venkatesan along with five others have reached Biradavada junction road (National Highway-71) in Naidupeta on February 6. The accused have used fake documents to transport the pigeons in the truck.
