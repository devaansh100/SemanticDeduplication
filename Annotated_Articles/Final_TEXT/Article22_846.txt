['Man arrested in Hooghly for ‘selling’ ivory items\nA man was arrested in Hooghly district for allegedly trying to sell ivory statuettes on Wednesday. The accused, Narayan Majhi, in his 40s, is a resident of Begampur in Hooghly, around 32km northwest of Kolkata. Based on a tip-off, officials from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and the Howrah forest division conducted a raid on his house posing as buyers. Four ivory statuettes were seized from him. “Each item would cost at least a few lakhs of rupees in the grey market,” a forest official said. Elephants are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing the animal or keeping any ivory item can invite three to seven years in jail and a fine that can run up to Rs 25,000. Majhi will be produced in court on Thursday.']
