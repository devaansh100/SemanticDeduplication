Villagers of Debandra gram panchayat demanded immediate closure of the mill before it causes a grave threat to the environment.“The flapshell turtle in the ‘vulnerable’ category of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has great importance as it is morphologically an evolutionary link between softshell and hardshell aquatic turtles,” said Bengal Biodiversity Board chairman H S Debnath. He had alerted the state pollution control board and the forest department about the deaths.According to locals, the rice mill has been draining untreated effluent into a canal. On Wednesday, villagers were shocked to find hundreds of turtles floating dead in the lake and stacked on the adjacent rice field.Local resident Suranjan Das said, “The rice mill used to release untreated sewage into the canal. The canal water must have flown into the lake. If the turtles cannot survive in the water, our future is in grave danger. We demand immediate closure of the mill.” Ranjit Jana , a panchayat member, said the panchayat pradhan was informed about how the rice mill was polluting the water.The rice mill manager, Dipak Ponda , said they were not aware of the incident. “We are hearing it for the first time. We have to see whether it was the water from the factory responsible for the turtle deaths or something else killed them,” he said.Contai forest official Balaram Panja said an investigation was underway.']
