Our squad was chasing the arrested men for past two weeks after being directed by higher-ups in the department,” Muktaposhi section forester Chandra Sekhar Behera said. “Today, we were successful in arresting both hunters and have seized wild boar meat from their possession. The department will intensify surveillance activities in the days ahead,” he added. On the other hand, Bhaskar refuted the charge saying, “We are innocent and have not hunted. We were hired by some unknown hunters just for chopping the meat. Initially, we were hesitant to do so. As the hunters forced us, we agreed for Rs 200 each towards wage.” PNN']
