As we learned that they were trying to sell the body parts near Butibori MIDC, a team led by vigilance RFO Fanindra Gadewar arrested them. Both admitted that they were trying to strike a deal in Chandrapur itself,” said deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada.According to forest officials, Dable doubled up as a tantrik and used tiger body parts to earn easy money. His farm is an encroachment on forest land and the cub was picked up from the forest in May when the mother tigress must have been away in the forest for hunting, they said.During interrogation, Dable is learned to have told the officials that he hid the cub in the makeshift hut on his farm and tried to keep it alive. Forest officials are not ready to believe his theory and apprehend the cub must have died due to starvation.The dried carcass of the cub had small nails and whiskers, and its teeth were also intact.ACF Chandewar said, “We are trying to find out whether the accused are linked to earlier poaching cases.”“It is really shocking that how Saoli range forest officer (RFO) Vasant Kamdi and field staff were unaware about the whereabouts of the cubs and tigress. When tigress with cubs is reported, protection needs to be enhanced. The incident occurred in May and the staff was unaware about it for four months,” said Uday Patel, honorary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli.']
