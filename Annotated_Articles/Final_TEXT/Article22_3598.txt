It was captured by blogger SS Sudheesh Kumar Vava Suresh is currently undergoing treatment at Kottayam Medical College Hospital and has shown slight improvement in his health condition. Suresh caught the snake by its tail and tried to put it in the sack five times. The snake bit Vava Suresh on his right leg unexpectedly on his fifth attempt to put the snake in the sack. He pulled the snake away with force and threw it away. He can be seen pressing his hands over the bitten region and forcing the blood out from there. Vava Suresh again caught the cobra that had started crawling back towards the pile of rocks, trapped it in a big tin and put the tin in the vehicle. He then performed first aid all by himself and tied a washcloth above the bitten region. Vava Suresh told panchayat member BR Manjeesh to rush him to the nearest hospital as soon as possible. ‘This snake is dangerous', he said. They decided to take him to Kottayam Medical College Hospital. Vava Suresh had come to Jaladharan’s house in Kurichy to catch the snake with BR Manjeesh. They started their way to the hospital in the same vehicle. Suresh felt that the vehicle was not travelling at enough speed so he requested to switch cars. Vava Suresh was then shifted to Jaladharan’s son Niju’s car. His condition deteriorated by the time they reached Pallam. Suresh asked them to take him to the nearest hospital. He tried to induce vomiting and patted over his chest to regulate his breathing."]
