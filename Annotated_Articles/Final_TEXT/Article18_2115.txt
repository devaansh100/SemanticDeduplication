All 185 passengers were evacuated safely. During rotation, the cockpit crew suspected a bird hit Engine 1. Since the crew did not observe any abnormality, the aircraft continued to climb further. advertisement Once the cabin crew noticed sparks coming out of Engine 1, they informed the Pilot-in-Command, who immediately requested an emergency landing. The director of Patna airport has said that SpiceJet is arranging an alternate flight for the passengers. A detailed investigation will also follow. The spokesperson for Spicejet said, "On June 19, 2022, SpiceJet B737-800 aircraft was operating SG-723 (Patna-Delhi). On takeoff, during rotation, the cockpit crew suspected a bird hit Engine #1. As a precautionary measure and as per SOP, the Captain shut down the affected engine and decided to return to Patna. The aircraft landed safely in Patna and passengers were safely deboarded. Post-flight inspection showed the bird hit with 3 fan blades damaged." Also Read | Patna-Delhi SpiceJet plane with 185 flyers makes emergency landing after wing catches fire --- ENDS ---']
