['New rescue centre for free ranging deer\nCHENNAI: Free ranging spotted deer found across 14 residential areas in the city will soon be moved to Guindy National Park (GNP) as wildlife officials have identified an acre of land inside GNP adjacent to the children’s park.A senior wildlife official told TOI that a couple of years ago, a small area—about 2,400sqft—was fenced and spotted deer rescued from Taramani and other residential localities, were released here. However, the cramped space led to infighting, which resulted in the death of about a dozen of them. Following this, the rescue work was stopped for a while.Now, wildlife officials have restarted capturing of deer roaming in residential areas. They have already identified two places in the city. Once the fencing work is completed, the rescued deer will be released here, he said. The smaller rehabilitation centre will be converted into a rehabilitation home for birds that are rescued.Barn owls, finches, munias, parakeets are the commonly rescued ones. Since these birds cannot feed on their own, they will not survive if released, he said.']
