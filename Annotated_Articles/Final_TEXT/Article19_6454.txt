Wild guess!!ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜… â€” Lt Gen K J Singh (@kayjay34350) December 29, 2019 Survival or Lack of experience in hunting can lead to tiger hunting in packs, though very rare..best example is 4 Tiger sisters of Chandrapur Tiger Reserve!! â€” Siddharth Sharma (@sidduu96) December 29, 2019 One reason is the size and the other is quantity available the deer persuade is a male stag it\'s not a easy catch. The weight of deer is not less than 90-100 kg for sure so not that easy catch.  Now RBT\'S have to share their territory due to land squeezing also. I hope so. â€” AbhrankashðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@abhrankashdas) December 29, 2019 IFS officer Susanta Nanda further added in the comments section that, "It\'s sub adult tiger cubs which are hunting together and is rare. They learn to stalk the prey and hunt alone by about 18 months of age. Stay with mother till 2.5 years old after which they establish their own territory. This clip near a fire line is rare."
