The held mafia have been identified as Suresh Karna and Kalia Karna of Meghanad village under Ulunda police limits of the same district. Notably, a wild tusker had been found dead in Sarasdadar village under Ulunda Forest Range on November 19, 2019. Miscreants had decamped with the tuskers of the jumbo after killing him in an electric trap. While Forest Department officials have succeeded in arresting six persons involved in the case after conducting an investigation into the case subsequently, the main accused remained at large. On Monday, Subarnapur DFO Sushant Samantray laid a trap and as a part of it met the mafias posing as customers to buy the tusks. After the mafia duo from Rampur area reached the venue of the deal, Samantray arrested them to seize the tusks. “The seized 65 cm long tusks weigh around 3 kg and costs over lakhs,” said forest department source. Further investigation into the case is underway as the mastermind of the theft is still absconding.']
