And he nearly fell off his bike with the sudden realization hitting Parth Vyas, an avid cyclist, hard as he was pedalling through the fields near Dev Dam in Panchmahal five days ago.He couldn\'t believe his eyes to see the cub frolicking near a hutment in Dahisar village under the warm sun, happily unmindful of the man-animal tension or even the distrust among the two species.Vyas, a MBA student in Vadodara, told TOI, "I asked villagers about the cub and they told me it had strayed into the locality a few days ago."Leopard sightings in the village that bordered the forest area were not uncommon. "They said that the two-month-old cub may have got separated from its mother. Instead of panicking, the villagers took it upon themselves to nurture the cub and wait for the mother leopard to come looking for it."Vyas explained how the cub entered not just the mud hearths, but also made a warm cosy place in the hearts of the poor villagers\', comprising farmhands mainly. It could move in and out of home at will and find a home to sleep at night.Their houses were small and earnings even smaller, but that didn\'t stop the villagers from spending on the cub\'s food like chicken and other food. Usually, leopard attacks made people hostile towards the big cat but this was a pleasant surprise to see the man-animal bonding," Parth Vyas added.After playing with it for some time, Vyas wanted to make the villagers aware of the rules too. "I explained that forest rules make it imperative for them to inform officials about the cub. Their intentions were noble, but the law says that wild animals can\'t be kept at home. So, we informed the forest officials who rescued the cub on Monday," Vyas said.Incidentally, Vyas, as a sign of appreciation, gave the locals some money for feeding the cub. Praising the villagers for looking after the cub, Ranvirsinh Puar, range forest officer ( RFO ), Shivrajpur told TOI, "They saved a life. Such co-existence of wildlife and humans is always appreciated. We are now looking for the cub\'s mother and are confident that we will track her soon."']
