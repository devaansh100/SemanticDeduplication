Divisional forest officer (DFO) of Berhampur Amlan Nayak said it is one the largest single seizure of wildlife items in the last one decade in the division. Balaram was arrested and produced in court after interrogation. Search is underway at his house. The DFO confirmed that most of the seized wildlife items are old but one of hides is fresh. “We will appeal in the court to take Balaram on remand for further investigation,” Nayak added. On the other hand, Balaram pleaded innocence and said the items seized from his house were collected from the forest during a period of five years.
