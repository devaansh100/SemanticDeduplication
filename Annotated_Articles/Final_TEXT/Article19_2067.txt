["Vanambadi actor Sai Kiran rescues a Chameleon, requests fans not to harm any animal\nView this post on Instagram Today's rescue . They were about to smash this gentle angel. I am glad i was passing by and noticed it. Immediately held out my hand and he readily climbed and took refuge.. Chameleons are harmless beings. They are defenseless, slow and gentle. They neither bite, nor are they venomous. Please dont kill them due to false stories. BE KIND TO ALL BEINGS, FOR THAT IS TRUE RELIGION.😍❤️🐿️🐇🐀🦇🦎🐢🐊🐍🕊️🦆🦏🐘🐫🐗🦛 #animalrescue #reptile #abouttoday #omad #vegan #kindness #peaceful #randomguy"]
