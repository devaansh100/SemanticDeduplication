The two persons who committed the offence have escaped from Bodal village. Python is a Schedule 1 animal under Forest Wildlife Protection Act. An FIR has been registered under section 9 of the aforementioned Act," Bindu Patel, Assistant District Forest Officer, told ANI. "If the crime committed by the offenders is proved in the court, they will then be imprisoned for three to seven years and they will have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000," she added. The forest department has deployed five teams to trace the accused. Pythons are members of the Pythonidae family of snakes. There are about 26 different species within this family. They kill their prey through constriction, literally by squeezing the animal to death. Venomous snakes, on the other hand, kill their prey by biting and injecting venom through hollow fangs or teeth.']
