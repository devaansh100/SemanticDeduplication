(Photo: India Today) By Siraj Qureshi: The Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) team raided a godown in Agra\'s Pir Kalyani. In the raid, the wheat used was found to be of substandard quality and rats were also seen across the store. The FSDA team destroyed one quintal of substandard wheat and took samples of porridge and gram flour for testing. The store belongs to Agrawal Food Industries, where \'Rasoi Ratan\' brand flour is prepared. A notice has also been issued to the owner of the factory. advertisement The FSDA chief food safety officer, Ram Ashish Maurya, along with the team raided Agrawal Food Industries. On the spot, the owner of the factory, Rajesh Agrawal, was present. They checked the condition of wheat storage where dead rats were found. Also, feces of cats and rats were scattered all over. Rat poison pills were also found in the flour. On being questioned by the officials, "Would you make flour from this wheat?", the factory owner said that there are modern machines. "The machine separates the bad wheat before grinding the wheat from the flour," he said. When asked "How would the machine remove the smell of dead rats and the possibility of rat poison pills being crushed with the wheat?", Agrawal did not answer. City magistrate Pratipal Chauhan told India Today that during the raid, the team found dead rats in wheat. Nearly one quintal of wheat, where dead rats were found, was collected and destroyed. There was no ready-made flour in the factory, so samples of porridge and gram flour were collected and sent for testing. Chauhan said that the team had found extensive dirt in the warehouse during the raid. It was damp and there were cobwebs. There was no cleanliness. Nine employees were found working in the warehouse. They were not wearing aprons and gloves. --- ENDS ---']
