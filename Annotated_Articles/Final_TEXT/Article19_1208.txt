The veterinarians sedated it with five darts, following which the personnel threw ropes around the elephant’ s neck. They removed the radio collar from the jumbo.Later, Chinna Thambi was led to a truck. The elephant was taken to Varakaliyur elephant camp where it will be kept in captivity.The elephant was earlier captured from near Thadagam reserve forest in Coimbatore district on January 25 and was released into reserve forest near Topslip. However, it returned to human habitats and started raiding crops.']
