They take on the young, sick, pregnant or otherwise vulnerable as a fully-grown and healthy giraffe can easily knock the big cats off. A viral video of an encounter between a pride and a giraffe shows the supersized mammal kicking the lions off of its hindlimbs. Lions are the giraffe ’s main predators in the wild, but it’s not everyday that it comes to hunting down these colossal ruminants. The big cats usually go for deer and other mammals they can take on, but rarely a giraffe. This is because in order to dominate its prey in a typical fashion, the lion needs to grab a hold of the neck and that’s impossible with giraffes. But when things get dire in the wild, lions need to go for broke and pursue the supersized mammals. They will usually be young, sick or pregnant or otherwise vulnerable as a strong giraffe can more than give lions a run for their money with its defences, just like in this particular video of a wild encounter. A video of a pride of lion s taking turns to attack a giraffe is viral . One by one, each lion jumps and tries to cling on to the giraffe’s posterior. However, the resilient mammal thrashes violently, kicking the formidable beasts off with its hindlegs. The clip has racked up over 1.1 million views since being posted on Wednesday."]
