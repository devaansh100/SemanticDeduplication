['Munsiyari- 800km trip | Caught by Police in Almora at 1 am | snow baby❄️ | Patal Bhuvneshwar 🙏🙏\nWe still hve to cover 40 km. Then Tragedy......As we all know when EVERYTHING GOES WELL THEN SOMETHING TERRIFIC WILL HAPPEN. 💯 We were almost there and it was quite dark and my friend is riding the bike . There was a small water flow on the road. My friend thinks that it may be slippery so rather than going through sideway he tried to move over the water and then Bullet got stuck and due to imbalance he tried to use his legs but water pot is is deep and we fall in that pit of water. It was like 8 pm at night , temperature is like a very low as snow is there . We are not able to pickup the bike because of bags and stuff. Some people helped us and we try to manage to ride. My friend is totally wet and he was like shivering and i was not that much of wet because i fall apart from that pit. We remove our shoes and socks and tie them on bike. 😖 It was like snow on the road and we were wet and without shoes , so horrible to ride the bike but there was no other option.😞 After some time bike headlight got burst because water was filled into it.😨 But we have fog lights which helped us and then anyhow i managed to ride another 20 km in that condition and we were continuously looking for hotel but there was no one . When we got one , we were like where was the room, and give the keys of bike to owner to park it as we were not in that condition . Asked him to light up fire for us. He was a good person he gives us room at 1k and helped us alot.']
