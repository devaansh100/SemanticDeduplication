Wildlife officials told media outlets on Tuesday that an operation is underway to trap and relocate the animal. Personnel deployed at the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropic (ICRISAT) first spotted the big cat last week. While on patrol, they saw the animal again on Sunday and were able to take pictures and videos of it which were then shared with the forest department. Located barely 12 km from the main campus, a leopard was caught in the ICRISAT campus in 2014. A Shankaran, a forest official deployed in the area told news agency PTI that 11 cameras have been installed at key locations around the spot where the animal was spotted. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to ensure that rescue operations are conducted without putting any local in danger. Around this time last month, the University of Hyderabad had issued an advisory for its personnel and their families along with students asking them to exercise caution while moving outdoors owing to the presence of a big cat in the area. Trap cameras and cages were also set up in and around the university campus to trap the leopard. Guidelines had also been issued for personnel asking them to refrain from moving out of their housing facilities after dark. Must Read: More plastic than fish?
