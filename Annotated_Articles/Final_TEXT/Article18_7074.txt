We are down but not out.” Bronwyn Moss, manager of Akwaaba Predator Park in Limpopo told local news reports,”We suspect that the lions were all poisoned at the same time, but the poachers were disturbed by the security guards before they could get to the other lions,” Moss told to The Citizen. “We are devastated that this could happen on our doorstep and that our babies were killed for nothing. The poachers murdered five and only got parts from one. What an absolute waste of life,” she added. Facebook In a post on Facebook, staff wrote: “Tragedy struck last night at our park. We lost five lions to murderers. That is what they are, they killed our babies. Our hearts are broken. We are down but not out. As you may have seen, we are offering a cash reward for any information that leads to the successful capture and conviction of these murderers.']
