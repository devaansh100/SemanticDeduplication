We are surprised as to who brought these kangaroos here and how. We suspect these kangaroos were being smuggled to Nepal. But we are looking into the motive behind smuggling as well.‚Äù These animals were spotted by many local residents who were passing through the area. In one such video, the kangaroos are seen inspecting the surroundings and trying to eat the grass growing at the roadside, as curious people try to record their videos.
