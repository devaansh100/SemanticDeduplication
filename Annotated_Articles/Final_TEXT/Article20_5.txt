They later handed over the seized logs to forest officials in Chengalpet. Based on a tip, personnel from the Maraimalai Nagar police station raided a warehouse on Kamarajar Salai in Maraimalai Nagar in the morning and found red sanders logs hidden under areca palm trees at the facility. Later, they informed district forest ranger Pandurangan, who subsequently arrived at the spot with his team. Investigation revealed that the warehouse belonged to Palani of Ambattur. He had rented it out to Sheik Ali of Manali for Rs 1.8 lakh a month. After preliminary inquiries, forest officials said that Sheik Ali hired the premises on December 16 claiming that areca stems for export would be stored there.After the red sanders logs were removed, the warehouse was sealed. A hunt has been launched for both Palani and Sheik Ali, as they have absconded. In the past one year, red sanders have been seized from multiple warehouses in Maraimalai Nagar and forest officials are investigating if the culprits use the area to hide the logs to be later smuggled to different places.']
