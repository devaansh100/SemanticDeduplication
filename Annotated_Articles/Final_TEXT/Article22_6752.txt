Police suspect water poisoning due to pesticides or poaching. Bhopal: Half a dozen : Half a dozen deer were found dead under mysterious circumstances with private parts and antlers of two of them chopped off in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh , reported TOI. Two of the deer were already dead when discovered by the villagers in Neemsarai village of Harda district. Four of them were still panting but in bad shape. The villagers reportedly tried to give water to the deer and tend to their wounds, but they died anyway. They were found in a gasping condition and died a couple of hours after the discovery. Three of them were males and three females. According to reports, the antlers and private parts of two of the deer were cut. Locals and the police have several theories regarding the deaths of wild animals. Some suspect that they consumed poisonous water used by locals for fishing. Sometimes poisonous pesticides are also put in the groundnut and pulses farms in the area, which might also have led to the deaths. Some villagers were rounded up for questioning. Another theory includes poaching of the animals for smuggling their organs. Some cases have earlier come to light related to poaching of sloth bears for their reproductive organs but such a case for deer would be the first. The police are investigating the matter and have sent the carcasses for autopsy. It was not clear if the animals died after excessive bleeding due to mutilation of their body parts or if they died first and then their parts were cut off.']
