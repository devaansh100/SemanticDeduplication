['Poisoned water kills antelopes and barking deers in MTR\nNagpur: Five four-horned antelopes ( chousingha ) and two barking deer were found dead near a perennial water source in Melghat Tiger Reserve MTR ) in Amravati district.According to Melghat officials, the carcasses were found on Wednesday in the Raipur forest range under Sipna wildlife division . Prima facie, the seven herbivores are suspected to have died due to poisoning after drinking water.Four-horned antelopes are listed under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and invite the same sections and punishment as tiger poaching. Besides, barking deer is listed under Schedule III of the Act.Deputy conservator (DyCF) Divya Bharathi M said samples of the body parts of the dead animals have been sent to the regional forensic science laboratory, Amravati, and Wildlife Research and Training Centre (WRTC), Gorewada. "We also collected samples for forensic tests and sent them to the Centre for Cellular Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad," said the DyCF."The field staff scanned the entire area based on which we are zeroing in on the suspects. Investigations are going on and statements of some persons have been recorded," Bharathi said.Poisoning by using urea is a big menace in Melghat but in this case, the motto to poison the water source could not be known. The animals that approached the nullah to quench thirst must have died after drinking the water.Chousingha is India\'s smallest bovid. It is found in dry deciduous forests and is currently listed as \'Vulnerable\' on the IUCN Red List. At present, there is little scientific information available on the four-horned antelope and the habitat variables that influence its occurrence."One of the major threats for the species has been the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion and development," said former Amravati honorary wildlife warden Vishal Bansod.']
