He said 150 personnel, including forest, revenue, police and veterinary doctors are in the field. The thick bush and casuarina plantations in the area are making it difficult to spot the tiger, he said, and added that the first objective is to obstruct its movement towards human habitation and facilitate it towards Ommangi, where the forest starts.District forest officer I K P Raju said the tiger has killed three cattle and compensation was paid to the owners. He said the tiger seems to be moving towards the forest as per its pug marks."]
