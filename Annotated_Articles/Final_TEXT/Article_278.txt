These birds were meant to be sold in different markets of the city and its fringes Mohammed Faiyaz, alias Barka, who had allegedly been operating an illegal trade in birds for several years, was arrested from his house during the raid. More than 150 indigenous parakeets were rescued from a house near the Narkeldanga intersection by officials of the forest department and the wildlife unit of Calcutta police’s detective department on Thursday. An official of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) said they had received information that a consignment of birds had landed at Faiyaz’s house. These birds were meant to be sold in different markets of the city and its fringes, including Galiff Street in north Calcutta, where birds are sold every Sunday, a forest official said. Trading in indigenous parakeets is prohibited under the Wildlife Protection Act. Agni Mitra, the regional deputy director, WCCB, said they found the birds crammed inside small cages. The rescued birds have been sent to the Wild Animal Rescue and Transit Facility Centre in Salt Lake.
