The horns smuggled from the Northeast find their way to international markets, where they are prized and valued very highly. The horns of the rhinos are made into decorative ornaments and sold in the market for exorbitant prices. In some cases, rhino horns are sometimes bought for the sole purpose of being gifted to others; to family members, business colleagues or people in positions of authority. Those purchasing rhino horn believe that owning rhino horn, as well as being able to purchase it for others, reaffirms their social status and strengthens the bonds among peers within their particular network.
