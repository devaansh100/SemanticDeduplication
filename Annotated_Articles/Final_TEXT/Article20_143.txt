A case was registered by the range forest office, (RFO) Panaji, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The accused was identified as Allan Tizon Jaraba and produced before the Mapusa JMFC after arrest, sources said. “It’s a shame that items made from the skin of species protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act are sold so openly by foreigners in Goa and that the authorities either are unaware of or don’t want to take action. We need to stop sale of such , to stop poaching and prevent the destruction of wildlife,” said president, People For Animals, Norma Alvares.']
