['Bail denied to two caught with sea cucumber worth Rs 2 crore\nMadurai: Dismissing the bail plea of a man who was arrested for illegal possession of 2,800kg of sea cucumbers worth about Rs 2 crore in Ramanathapuram district, the Madras high court has observed that over-exploitation of sea cucumbers not only affects the marine ecosystem, but also the human ecosystem, more particularly the fishermen, as both are interdependent.The court made the observations while hearing the bail plea of Villayutham, who was arrested by the Jetty police in Ramanathapuram district. The court had dismissed his bail plea by taking into account that there were 13 previous cases of similar nature against him.Pursuant to an earlier direction, G Venkatesh, forest range officer of Mandapam wildlife range had submitted a report before the court. Justice B Pugalendhi observed observed that over-exploitation of sea cucumbers would decrease sediment health, reduce nutrient recycling and potential benefits of deposit feeding to sea water chemistry, diminish biodiversity of associated symbionts and reduce the transfer of organic matter from detritus to higher trophic levels. To avoid such a situation, sea cucumbers are listed in Schedule I, Part IV-C of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and are strictly banned for collection and for trade in India, from 2001.The judge observed that a blanket submission was made that the sea cucumbers are caught in the net while fishing and that they are not caught intentionally. This court is not inclined to accede to the said submission for the reason that sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor and not on the surface of the sea or the inter-space.The judge observed that in the present case, though the FIR was registered in June, no steps were taken to transfer the files to the forest officials. Such conduct on the part of the police needs to be deprecated, as it would give room for the offenders to come out on statutory bail for non-filing of chargesheet.Hence, the judge directed the Ramanathapuram superintendent of police to look into this matter and take action against the concerned erring officials. The judge also directed the SP to issue necessary directions to the officials to avoid the recurrence.']
