['Calls grow for immediate capture of Durgapur leopard\nChandrapur: People’s representatives have stepped up the demand for immediate capture of the problem leopard responsible for multiple human kills in the shrubby stretches of Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) in Duragpur.There was outrage after an eight-year-old boy Pratik Bawane was killed by a leopard lurking in the shrubs late on Wednesday night in Durgapur.On Thursday, NCP neta Nitin Bhatarkar barged into the WCL office in Durgapur shouting slogans and damaged showcases and windows. He was protesting WCL’s inaction in clearing the shrubs on its land along the roads and near human habitation.Bhatarkar has been pursuing the issue for the last few years. He has submitted memorandums and staged agitations to demand mitigation measures to curb the man-animal conflict in the area.Bhatarkar said that the shrubby stretches on WCL and CSTPS lands have become habitat of predators. “Tigers and leopards have claimed 13 lives in the last three years. There have been three human kills since February 16. Despite my repeated demand, the WCL officials and forest department have not cleared the shrubs,” said Bhatarkar.Former forest minister and MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar too demanded immediate measures to capture the problem leopard and warned of agitation if the forest department failed to act. He expressed concern over intrusion of predators in urban areas. He also suggested using siren system like that in Madhya Pradesh, which helps in warning people about intrusion of wild animals in human settlements.Sources said that forest officials have called a meeting on Friday of local advisory committee as per SOPs of NTCA to decide over the fate of the problem leopard. The committee is likely to propose tranquilizing the beast for capturing it.']
