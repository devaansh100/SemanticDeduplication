['Cool news for canine friends: SWAN, GHMC to set up water bowls for strays across Hyderabad\nHyderabad: Bringing respite to the heat and thirst of stray dogs during the hot summer season, NGO Sakuntala Society for Welfare of Animals and Nature (SWAN) has joined hands with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and is planning to set up water bowls for stray dogs across Hyderabad. On 9 April, SWAN took up the responsibility to prepare water bowls for stray dogs across the north zone areas of GHMC. A group of NGO volunteers and children, who attended Saturday\'s programme, painted 200 water bowls. The initiative is not only going to benefit stray dogs but also other stray animals like birds and squirrels. The NGO is planning to install these painted bowls in and around Himayatnagar and Secunderabad from Monday. According to Harsh Bhatnagar, the founder-president of SWAN, every citizen must protect stray animals like dogs, cats, cattle, and birds from this soaring summer heat. "In summers, dogs are badly in need of drinking water. If they do not get water, they become restless and aggressive. It could even result in dog bites and fights between dogs," said Harsh.']
