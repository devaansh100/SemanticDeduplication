['Maharashtra: Eight-week-old leopard cub pair reunites with mother\nPUNE: In a rescue operation carried out by Wildlife SOS and the Maharashtra forest department, two eight-week-old leopard cubs found in a sugarcane field in Ale village , Junnar subdivision were rescued and reunited with their mother.Just days after four cubs were safely rescued and reunited with their mother in Kabadwadi Village, sugarcane farmers from Ale Village in Otur forest range stumbled upon two more leopard cubs.They alerted the state forest department who contacted the Wildlife SOS team operating out of the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre for further assistance.Upon arrival, Wildlife SOS veterinarian Dr Nikhil Bangar conducted on-site health check-up. On further examination, he identified the cubs as one male and one female, approximately eight-weeks- old. The cubs were then taken to the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre for further medical examination and on being declared healthy, they were found fit to be reunited with their mother.On Saturday night, the team placed the cubs in a safe box close to the location from where they were retrieved. To ensure a successful reunion, the rescue team lined the safe box with the cubs’ urine drops, so that it acted as a scent marking to assist the mother leopard in locating the cubs more easily. Camera traps captured the moment when the mother leopard found her cubs and carefully carried them away to a safer location. Dr Bangar , veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS said, “Sugarcane farmers of Maharashtra have to tread very carefully because harvest season coincides with the birthing period of leopards. The dense sugarcane fields foster a suitable shelter for leopards to breed in and nurture their cubs but this also gives rise to conflict situations. This is the second reunion operation we have conducted this month.”']
