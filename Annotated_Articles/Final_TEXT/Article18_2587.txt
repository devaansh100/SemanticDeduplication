['Over 11,000 venomous snakes rescued within one-and-half years in Kerala\nKonni: Over 11,000 extremely venomous and less venomous snakes were caught within one-and-half years in Kerala. 102 snakes among them were King Cobra. According to the data collected from January 2021 to May 2022, a total of 2,646 poisonous snakes were rescued from Kannur. Alappuzha district with no forest regions is the only district from where no King Cobras were caught. 107 species of snakes are usually found in Kerala. All the snakes except Indian rat snakes (‘chera’) were released in the forest after catching it. The rat snakes were not disturbed as they are considered to be environment-friendly snakes which keep rodents at bay. Most of the snakes rescued in this period were cobras. Boa constrictors (‘malampampu’), Russell’s viper (‘anali’), Common krait (‘vellikettan’) and Cobra (‘moorkhan’) are the snakes commonly found in residential regions. If snakes are spotted, public can obtain immediate help from the forest department by sending a message through the SARPA app.']
