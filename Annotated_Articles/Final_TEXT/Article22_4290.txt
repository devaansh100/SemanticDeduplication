Earlier today, we were relocating crocodilians to another area of the zoo. They were secured and placed into our zoo van. This animal broke the back window of the van and made a dash down the road. Our crew acted quickly to recapture it and deliver it safely to its new habitat. At no time was there any real danger as the animal’s mouth was secured,” the caption read. The officials also gave a whole lot of credit to the women who successfully caught the crocodile. “And impressive GIRL POWER! Karsyn (Reptile Keeper) and Gen (General Curator) recaptured it, with help from Ryan and Donald from maintenance,” the post further read."]
