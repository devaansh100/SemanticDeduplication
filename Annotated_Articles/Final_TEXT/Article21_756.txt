However, as per law, he should have informed the forest authorities about these birds and not kept them like this privately."The operation was coordinated by WCCB regional deputy director Yogesh Warkad (IFS), and deputy conservator of forest, Thane, Gajendra Hire (IFS). The raiding team was led by RFO (Mumbai) Rakesh Bhoir.Other team members during the raid were WCCB constables Sappan Mohan, Sandip Yewale, Vijay Nandeshwar, round officer Shankar Ainwad, and forest guards Nilesh Malekar, Ramesh Jadav, Pradeep Kamadi and Pankaj Kumbhar.A few dead birds were also found in the cages, while several common birds like pigeons, crows, hens, and also rabbits were found on the house terrace.']
