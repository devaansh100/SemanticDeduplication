['Crocodile With Tire Stuck Around Its Neck For Six Years Finally Freed\nHelping out animals is a kind and selfless deed to do, and sometimes people put their own lives at risk to do so. This incident is an excellent example of someone who went out of his way to help, not just any animal, but a crocodile. Crocodiles are known to be ferocious predators, and humans usually stay far away from the reptiles. However, when the need of the hour was to watch out for a specific crocodile, this man did not hesitate one bit. According to reports, a saltwater crocodile in Indonesia had a tire stuck around its neck for six years, and has now finally been freed by an animal lover on the island of Sulawesi. The man is a local resident. instagram People who live in the city of Palu were scared that the tire might eventually choke the 13.12-foot-long reptile as it grew in size. The croc had been the subject of attempted rescue efforts before. Crocodile wrangler and National Geographic TV presenter Matt Wright flew to Indonesia in 2020 in a bid to free the animal but was unsuccessful. Now, a local resident named Tili has removed the tire from the crocodile’s neck. “I caught the crocodile by myself. I was asking for help from people here but they were scared,” Tili, 35, told Reuters. He set up a basic trap with a rope tied to a log and used live chickens and ducks as bait. He tracked the croc for three weeks, but the reptile managed to escape on two occasions before being captured.  instagram Tili said that people were skeptical and thought that he was not serious about capturing the reptile. When he trapped the crocodile, he used a saw to remove the tire. “I just can’t stand to see animals hurt. Even snakes, I will help,” Tili said. The reptile, which local people had referred to as “buaya kalung ban” (crocodile with a tire necklace), was released back into the river on Monday evening. In 2020, the Indonesian authorities offered a reward to rescue the croc. The croc had the tire around its neck when it was first spotted roaming in the Palu River to Palu Bay in 2016. It survived the tsunami and earthquake that struck Palu in 2018 with the tire lodged around its neck. Ever since then, the crocodile was stuck with a tire around its neck for six whole years.  instagram For more trending stories, click here.']
