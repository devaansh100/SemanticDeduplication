['Madhya Pradesh: Another tiger carcass found in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve\nRepresentational pic | Bhopal: A three-day-old carcass of a male tiger was found in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve on Monday. The last rites were performed in the evening. The carcass of a male tiger, almost three days old, was found in the Manpur area of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. Forest officials could not ascertain the reason for the body being mutilatedâ€”whether due to natural decay in the past three days or for some other reason. This is the third such incident this year in the Bandhavgarh reserve when a tiger was found dead. Sources in the forest department say that the circumstances indicate that the death of the tiger happened under mysterious circumstances. Some nature-lovers have decided to complain about the matter to the National Tiger Conservation Authority and ask them to look into the frequent deaths of tigers happening in the reserve.']
