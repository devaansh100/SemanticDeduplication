According to the agency, this is the latest seizure fuelled by the growing demand for exotic pets in China. The harvester ants were sealed in test tubes with a nutrient solution and were probably being mailed into China as pets, customs officials from Changsha told the news agency. According to the customs officials, there were 37 black-and-red queen ants and a large number of worker ants. Their length was about 1.4 centimetre. Owing to the harvester ants’ beautiful appearance and fast reproduction cycle, they are gaining popularity among China’s pet lovers. The laws of the country state that live insects are banned from entering via mail as illegal mailing could pose a threat to China’s eco-system, customs officials told Xinhua news. They also added that they would probably destroy the ant parcel. Now, exotic animals like snakes, lizards, and a variety of insects are even being bought online as China is experiencing an e-commerce boom of sorts. E-commerce has also been blamed for fueling the smuggling of foreign and endangered species in the country.']
