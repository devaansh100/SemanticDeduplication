['Temple elephant attacked by handler for the second time in Tamil Nadu | Video\nA video of a temple elephant, Jyomala, being attacked by her handler in Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar has raised concerns about the safety of temple elephants. Activists are discussing whether the elephant should be seized and kept in a camp. By Pramod Madhav: A video of a temple elephant in Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar district being attacked by its handler has raised concerns about the safety of temple elephants. Joymala, an elephant from Assam, was gifted to the Srivilliputhur temple in Virudhunagar district ten years ago. Last year, the elephant was in the news when a video of her handler, Raja, brutally attacking the elephant went viral. This led to his removal. advertisement However, a video has now gone viral of the new handler attacking Joymala with a stick. This has raised concerns over the safety of temple elephants. Sources also stated that Joymala is being kept in Tamil Nadu without adequate papers. Wildlife authorities are now discussing whether the elephant should be seized and kept in a camp. Environmentalists who’ve been closely monitoring Joymala claim that she is not capable of listening to her handler’s commands due to extensive abuse in the past. However, the temple authorities stated that the incident occurred in June 2021 but the video has gone viral now and the Mahout has been removed. --- ENDS ---']
