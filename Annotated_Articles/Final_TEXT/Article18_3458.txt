['Awful! The leopard proves to be a dwarf in front of the monkey, the defeated hunter hunting in agility game\nForest. Jungle (Wildlife videosIt is very difficult to say when what will happen and who will be heavy on whom and the law of the jungle says so. There are many types of animals, but the leopard is an animal that can kill any animal with its agility. No one else in the jungle is equal to agility. But if the matter is done quickly, then the name of the monkey comes to the top and this is why it is almost impossible to hunt monkeys in the forest, but many times it wants to kill the brain, but in the end the result is the same as everyone imagined. Something like this has come to the fore nowadays, where a leopard in the pursuit of power wanted to prey on a monkey, but what happened after that is really surprising. It is said that when the soul comes, the same energy comes in the fox. Nowadays, there are some places where a leopard climbed a tree to hunt a monkey, but despite all his efforts, he could not make a single hair of the monkey. Watch the video here You can’t catch me pic.twitter.com/ffBywuPZoY – Fred Schultz (FredSchultz35) April 24, 2022 You have often seen that leopards are very good at climbing trees and they often go to the trees with their prey so that no other predator can snatch their prey, but here the whole thing is reversed, here a leopard hunted a monkey. In the end, he had to face it. Read this too As seen in the video, the leopard climbs the tree to catch the monkey, the monkey hangs from the tree branch to save himself. As soon as the leopard reaches the monkey, the monkey jumps to the other branch of the tree and as the leopard moves to the other branch, the monkey jumps to the other side. Seeing these two, it seems as if they are playing with each other. It was fun to watch between the two of them, but in response to the leopard’s agility in front of the monkey’s motion, he finally sat down tired.']
