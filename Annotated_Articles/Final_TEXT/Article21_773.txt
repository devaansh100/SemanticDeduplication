['BSF seizes 5 birds being smuggled to B’desh\nKolkata: Border Security Force on Friday night seized five straw-necked ibis being smuggled from India to Bangladesh. These birds , commonly found in Australia, were handed over to the Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary Authority.A troop of BSF jawans were manning the Indo-Bangladesh border when they spotted cartons and found the birds inside. “These are farmed birds and need specialized facilities that can handle them. South Africa is a big hub for straw-necked ibis, but some European countries breed them too,” said Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of the Bird Watchers’ Society.“Black ibis, glossy ibis and red-naped ibis can be found in India. But this species has not been spotted in the country,” said Suman Pratihar, a bird enthusiast and assistant professor of zoology at Keshpur College.']
