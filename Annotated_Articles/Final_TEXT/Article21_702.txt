Pradeepan, forest range officer, Meppadi, said the accused killed and sold the venison of a six-year-old male barking deer (Cervus unicolor), which had been trapped in a plastic net used by farmers for detracting wild animals from entering into a private land. It was suspected that the accused were members of a poaching racket, Mr. Pradeepan said. The officials also seized the venison and a bike used by the team for transportation. The accused would be produced in the First Class Judicial Magistrate Court here.']
