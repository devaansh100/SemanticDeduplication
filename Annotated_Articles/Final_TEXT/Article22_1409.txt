Barely three weeks ago, an adult red kangaroo had been rescued from Kumargram near Buxa on the Bengal-Assam border. The animals, native to Australia, are not found in the wild in India.A forest department patrol party and passers-by first spotted two kangaroos hopping along the busy Gajoldoba Canal Road on Friday evening. Another was found in a forest patch nearby. The foresters suspect the animals were being smuggled to Nepal and were abandoned by the roadside when the perpetrators realised a patrol party was doing the rounds."We received information about wildlife smuggling. Around 8.30pm, a patrol team near Gajoldoba Canal Road found the kangaroos. They were rescued and brought to Belakoba range office," said ranger Sanjay Dutta.On Saturday morning, residents of Nepali bustee spotted a dead kangaroo. "It is suspected the animal was killed by a dog or jackal," said a forester.The three kangaroos rescued in Jalpaiguri and the carcass of a fourth have been taken to Bengal Safari, the wildlife animal park in Siliguri, for medical aid and autopsy. The foresters are on the lookout for more kangaroos in the nearby forests."All the kangaroos are juveniles and we\'ve got information that a few more are still out there. We suspect the animals are being bred in captivity for illegal smuggling. They were probably being sent to a private collector," said Sourav Chowdhury, member secretary of West Bengal Zoo Authority.Baikunthapur DFO Hari Krishnan said a team of vets was examining the three kangaroos and "they all seem healthy". Park director Dawa S Sherpa Rai added that the kangaroos were sub-adult and had been kept under observation.Forest minister Jyotipriya Mallick said a special committee had been formed to probe the matter. "Arrangements will be made to keep the kangaroos either at Bengal Safari or Darjeeling zoo or Alipore zoo. It will depend on their physical condition," he added.Chowdhury said since Alipore zoo now houses grey kangaroos and has expertise in treating the kangaroos for years, the rescued animals are likely to be brought to the city zoo.']
