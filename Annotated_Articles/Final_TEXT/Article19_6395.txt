Leopards are straying in our locality quite regularly these days as a result of which we cannot go out after dusk. We are spending sleepless nights because of the straying big cats,” Santanu Kurmmi, a garden worker said. Leopards are straying into the tea garden areas because of the shrinking habitat. “The local residents informed us about the leopard. We sent our team to the tea garden to rescue the leopard. The animal was later released at Dihing Patkai reserve forest,” said Dibrugarh forest ranger Nareswar Das. He said three leopards were caged and released at Dihing Patkai reserve forest in the past month. However, man-animal conflict has been on the rise in Assam because of the shrinking habitat. Animals often come out of the forest in search of food.']
