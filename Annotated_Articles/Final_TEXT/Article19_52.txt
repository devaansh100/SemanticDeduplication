The big cat was caught from the basement of Hotel Satkar Residency, Pokhran Road, around 11.50 am, PTI quoted a senior forest official as saying. Before being taken away, the leopard was tranquilised and will be released in Sanjay Gandhi National Park after examination, officials said. The leopard was first seen in the parking area of Korum Mall in the wee hours of the morning at around 5.30 am, following which few people alerted police and forest officials who conducted a search in the mall for about three hours, PTI quoted Thane civic body’s regional disaster management cell chief Santosh Kadam as saying.
