['Man Arrested For Killing 3-year-old Barking Deer\nGUWAHATI: The state forest department on Wednesday arrested one person for allegedly killing a three-year-old male barking deer, also called the Indian Muntjac (Sagoli Pohu in Assamese), under the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in Guwahati’s Mathgharia area under the jurisdiction of the Narengi forest beat office.The arrested has been identified as Shyam Chandra Rai (35) of Dhubri. He, along with Mohammed Sahil and Arman Pramanik , were working as labourers at a construction site at Mathgharia. Forest beat officer Ashim Das told TOI, “The deer came out of the Hengerabari reserve forest and entered the premises of a building under construction where Rai and the two other labourers were working. Rai killed the deer.”Acting on information, the forest team, led by Das, rushed to the spot and detained the trio. “Sahil and Pramanik gave testimony against Rai and so they were released. The accused had planned to sell the venison. Later, we produced Rai before the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup (Metro),” he added.“Our patrolling team has often found herds of deer and other animals coming out of the Hengerabari reserve forest in search of food. Man-animal conflict is rising due to shrinkage of forest areas. The food base of animals is shrinking. The area where the incident took place was a habitat of animals now people are occupying the area. But that does not mean they will kill animals,” he added.']
