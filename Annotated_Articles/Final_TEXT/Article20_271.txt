Two fined for smuggling sandalwood During interrogation, the nine men revealed that another individual, identified as S. Ravi from Siriyur, used to smuggle sandalwood from the forests. When Ravi was questioned, he revealed that he was a shepherd who used to collect small bits of bark and root from dead sandalwood trees while taking his livestock into the forest and would then hand it over to a Bokkapuram resident A. Mohammad Ali. Both Ravi and Mohammad Ali were arrested and let off with a fine of ₹ 20,000 each.']
