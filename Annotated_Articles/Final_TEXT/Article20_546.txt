All the accused have been booked under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 on the charges of poaching activities in Kapilash forest range. The development comes at a time when there is a rise in poaching activities in Kapilash forest range. Recently the forest department had arrested two persons and recovered a live pangolin weighing 15 kilograms from their possession. The accused were identified as Ghanshyam Behera (21) and Jitendra Pradhan of Khordha district. Official sources said the duo had caught the pangolin from Kapilash sanctuary some 10 days back and was transporting the animal to Khordha district. The Dhenkanal forest department has sought assistance from the Special Task Force of the Crime Branch to bust the pangolin racket as it suspects that more animals have been captured from the Kapilash Sanctuary.']
