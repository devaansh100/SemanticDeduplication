He said he only used the best hair colour available for the purpose. By Nolan Pinto: Monkeys are one of the biggest problems farmers face in many parts of Karnataka. There have been cases where monkeys have been poisoned as well. But Srikanth Gowda, a resident of Nallur village, Theerthahalli taluk of Shivamogga district decided to use a unique ploy to deal with the menace and many other farmers in the Malnad region are now following suit. advertisement He painted stripes on his pet labrador, Bulbul, to make him look like a tiger. He said he only used the best hair colour available for the purpose. In fact, he remembered that his father told him how monkeys were scared of tigers and always maintained a distance from them. With a 53 acre plantation, it was next to impossible to manage the monkey menace any other way for the farmer. With his pet resembling a tiger, he says the monkeys, who have good eyesight, now stay away from his huge farm. He claimed that the monkeys have no food in the forests as most of the fruit-bearing trees have all vanished and hence they need to depend on raiding farms.
