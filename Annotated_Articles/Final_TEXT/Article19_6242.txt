The video – which displays speed and swiftness of both the animals – has created quite a stir among people on social media. There is a chance that you’ll find it fascinating too. Though it’s not clear who recorded the video, it was shared by Indian Forest Services officer Susanta Nanda on Twitter. The video shows the hyena and the leopard coming face-to-face from two opposite directions. The hyena tries to attack the big cat, almost at the same time the leopard twitches and jumps upwards towards a tree. Within splits of seconds, the leopard climbs it and avoids an engagement with the scavenger. “Sometimes the gap between life and death is a jump,” Nanda wrote. Further adding, lions and hyenas are the “only animals who occasionally attack adult leopards with fatal blows.” In the next line he explains the leopard’s leap saying that the animal did that to avoid “risk to injury or death by fighting a hyena.” Take a look at the incredible video: Sometimes the gap between life & death is a jump. Lions & hyenas are the only animals who occasionally attack adult leopards with fatal blows. It avoids risk to injury or death fighting a hyena. pic.twitter.com/XstMxXdGV8 — Susanta Nanda IFS (@susantananda3) October 18, 2019 Since being shared some 21 hours back, the video has gathered much attention from tweeple.
