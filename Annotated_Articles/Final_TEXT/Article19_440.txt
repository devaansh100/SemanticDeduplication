"I was informed by some local animal lovers this Sunday that a woman resident of Shrihari Complex housing society in Vitthalwadi, Kalyan, had tied a pigeon upside down with a rope outside her flat window for several hours.""The poor bird had struggled for over seven to eight hours in this desperate situation and continuously banged its body against the building exterior, leading to blood being splattered out. This is an atrocious case of torture of a pigeon,\'\' said Navani.She then went to the local police station on Monday to lodge the FIR under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960) section 11 (l) for fatally torturing a mute animal. ``I have gathered that the accused woman wanted to teach the pigeon a lesson for flying inside her flat and dirtying the place. Some of the other society residents also tried to intervene and stop the further torture of the bird, but the accused woman did not allow them to enter inside her house. This is so shocking and sad,\'\' said Navani.The senior police inspector of Kolshewadi police station, S B Salve, said that he is out of station, so the details can be got from the junior officials at the police station. Another official informed TOI: ``So far, we have only registered an FIR against the woman, V Aarothe, but she has not yet been arrested as we have to do further inquiry at her flat and collect witness statements.\'\'A local resident who regularly feeds stray animals and birds at Vitthalwadi, Kalyan, told TOI: ``Some of the society residents managed to click photos of the tied up pigeon, but unfortunately could not rescue it on time. This is a rare instance of a harmless bird like a pigeon being so brutally harmed. We hope tough action is taken by the law enforcers.\'\'']
