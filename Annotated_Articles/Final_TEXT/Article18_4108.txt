Estate workers noticed the dhole in a well at TANTEA facility and informed the Pandalur Forest Department officials, who then arrived and took efforts to rescue the animal. “It could not climb up through a ladder placed inside the dry well. Then, a staff member got down, tied a rope to its leg and moved it onto a net before lifting it out,” said an official. The two-year-old male retreated into forest. Similarly, workers noticed a leopard cub, barely a month old at a tea estate. “It was then released into the nearby forest hoping that it would rejoin its mother,” official said.']
