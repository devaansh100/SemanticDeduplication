The clip was shared on Twitter on Tuesday. As per local media reports, the animal was later transferred to the Assam State Zoo for treatment. Reports also said a 50-year-old woman, identified as Manju Bhattacharya, was attacked by the leopard in the Maligaon area on Tuesday morning and taken to Guwahati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).

Before that, a video shared by Indian Forest Service officer Ramesh Pandey on Twitter showed a man releasing a leopard from a truck parked on a river bed and the big cat instantly jumping away to freedom. Within seconds, it crossed a shallow water body and escaped into the wilderness.']
