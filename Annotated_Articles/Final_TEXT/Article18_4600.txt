Over the years, there have been several incidents of wild animals killing children and cattle, resulting in villagers killing leopards and elephants. Forest department officials said of the seven leopards that died since November last year, two were killed due to man-animal conflict.Besides, four elephants have died in the same period. One of the elephants was electrocuted on the bordering area of Amangarh Tiger Reserve area last month when it came in contact with solar fencing erected around a field.Now, farmers have approached the forest officials, saying that incidents of man-animal conflict are rising as there is no gap between human habitat and forest area in the plains. Often people fail to detect the presence of a wild animal till they come face to face in a potential man-animal conflict situation. Therefore, a safe zone is necessary, said Sunil Kumar from Keharipur , "It will enable farmers to keep a close watch on animals invading the plains.” Bijnor divisional forest officer Anil Kumar Patel said, “Farmers have demanded a safe zone between plain and forest land to avoid man-animal conflict.”']
