The video has gone viral with social media users coming up with their reactions over the video. Published by a user named snakebytestv to Instagram, the post has been captioned as, “Sometimes after a long day, taking a nap with your favorites is a must! I can’t be the only one.” The post has so far garnered more than 26k likes after getting published to Insta on May 26, 2022. And the post has earned different types of comments from the users. A user perhaps thinks that the man is actually not sleeping as he writes, “You’re not sleeping.” Another user wrote, “Snakes r so cool lol I wanna get a Mexican black kingsnake as a pet sometime.” And yet another user praised the reptile writing, “ OMG, he’s(not sure about the sex) so amazing. Love them a lot.” Another user commented, “This snack is so beautiful…. But I afraid on it …. They are very dangerous….how can u stay with snack.” It is not clear why the user has written ‘snack’ in place of ‘snake’. Another Insta user perhaps gets jealous with the man in the video as the comment says, “Wow… How can u chill like that.” And another user comments, “OMG!! They are sizing you up to eat! Don’t you know to never sleep with snakes.” Watch the video here:']
