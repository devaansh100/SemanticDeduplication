The birds, being smuggled from Bangladesh to India, were stuffed in two cages.“Around 10.30 pm on Monday, troops of the 158Bn BSF posted at the Pipli Border Outpost acted on specific information and laid an ambush. On being challenged, a few suspects crossing the border illegally fled through the dense vegetation, dropping the two cages. The birds have been handed over to the director of the Alipore Zoo through the Customs department in Petrapole,” a senior BSF official said.Nearly a 100 exotic birds have been seized by the BSF along the Indo-Bangladesh border over the last few weeks. These birds are trafficked to markets in Kolkata and elsewhere and sold to collectors at high prices.']
