The incident reportedly happened in Sri Lanka and has left netizens furious. The TikTok video originally posted by a user who goes by the name @shashikagimhandha has been shared by Indian Forest Service officer Parveen Kaswan on Twitter. Kaswan shared the clip alongside the caption, "Identify the animal here. What a pathetic behaviour. You go in your home & do this. Just for a tik-tok video. From Sri Lanka. Such people should be called out." In the video, the TikTok user can be seen driving a vehicle at night and the headlights soon fell on an elephant who was on the road.
