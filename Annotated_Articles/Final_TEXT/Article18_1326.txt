Six chinkaras were found dead and the remains of another were found. The dead chinkaras included five females and a male, said officials, adding that three female chinkaras were pregnant. Sankda police station sub-inspector Khushala Ram confirmed the death of seven chinkaras. It is said that the chinkaras were killed by the dogs as the boundary wall prevented them from escaping.Forest department officials who reached the site on getting information about incident, took the carcasses of the chinkaras and got autopsies done. A team from Sankda police station also reached the spot. Since the solar power companies are recklessly felling trees in this area, wild animals are forced to roam here and there. tnn']
