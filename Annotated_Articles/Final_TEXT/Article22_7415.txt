While the animals are undergoing extreme trauma and fleeing for their lives, the sadistic vehicle driver appears to be having a good time as he continues to film the chase. A Twitter user identified the road as Samruddhi Mahamarg in Maharashtra. This driver must be crazy chasing black bucks in their own territory.
