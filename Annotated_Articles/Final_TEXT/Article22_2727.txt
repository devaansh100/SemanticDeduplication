The incident happened near Chenellimood region here on Saturday. The students unexpectedly came before the wild elephant and they ran to escape. On knowing about the incident, the parents and locals chased away the elephant back to the forest. A group of five students were chased away by an elephant here the other day. Not just elephants, a man who accompanied his children was attacked by a bison recently. Due to rampant attacks on the forest stretch, school students always commute in groups. The panchayat comes under Gothra Sarathi scheme in which special transportation arrangement to students living in the interior forests and inaccessible areas is provided. Earlier it was functioning properly, but it is almost stalled now.']
