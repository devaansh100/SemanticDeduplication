The bear was seen roaming in the area with its cubs. “In June 2018, a couple was killed and six others were injured by a wild bear in Sompeta mandal, neighbouring Vajrapu Kotturu mandal. Angry villagers chased the bear and killed it. This time too, the villagers tried to chase the bear, but were attacked by the wild animal,” Lakkoju Srinivasa, a native of the Uddanam area, stated. Fisheries minister Appala Raju talked over phone with the police chiefs and forest officials to advise them to trace the animal and take it to the Vizag zoo.']
