The top forest officer also informed that so far, two persons have been arrested from Dadgiri and Daimuguri-Laimuti in Chirang district on charges of illegally possessing elephant tusks. He said, “A total of 17 kg of elephants tusks have been recovered from the possession of the two arrested persons.” The DFO informed that the market value of all the tusks, recovered from different locations in Chirang district, will be around Rs 10 lakh. The forest officials with the help of Chirang police on Sunday nabbed one elephant tusk smuggler, identified as Alen Basumatary and recovered two tusks from his possession. DFO Patiri said the elephant tusk smugglers sell the tusks in China and Myanmar through Nepal.

The forest official sources said it is expected that more elephant tusk smugglers will land in the forest department’s net soon.']
