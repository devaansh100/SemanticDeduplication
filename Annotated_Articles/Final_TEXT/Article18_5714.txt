['Bear named Hank the Tank is on the run from California police\nUsually, bears are expected to be in hibernation in winters, but Hank the Tank has proved this wrong. Instead of sleeping through the season, the nearly 227 kg bear has gained notoriety for breaking into homes and foraging for food. As per BBC, he has barged into several homes in California’s Lake Tahoe neighbourhood that have prompted people to install extra safety measures. Authorities have said there have been more than 150 calls related to Hank and close to 40 break-ins have been attributed to the bear in just the past six months. What makes Hank so formidable is his large size. The Bear League, a wildlife conservation group, attributes his form to the fact that the animal has been consuming high-calorie human food instead of sustaining on wild produce. So far, authorities have tried to deter Hank from venturing into residential areas by shooting bean bag bullets and using sirens but these efforts have proved to be useless. The BBC reported that the bear might be euthanised after he is caught. Animal advocacy groups are opposing the option of euthanising the animal and demanding that Hank should instead be relocated to a bear sanctuary. “Hank is gentle and sweet. When he breaks into a home, he is far more interested in the food than any people… “‘He just sits there and eats,’ she said. ‘He doesn’t attack them. He doesn’t growl. He doesn’t make rude faces.’”#HankTheTank pic.twitter.com/e2bUim219d — Unruly Squirrel (@1UnrulySquirrel) February 21, 2022 Please don’t hurt Hank. The misconception is that he’s fine due his size but bears should be hibernating through winter. Hence, it may be the climate isn’t conducive; he’s awake, and hungry now. https://t.co/04BKJkuA1N — #RustyolTrusty 😷🧲💙🌊♻️🌳💚🐋🐬🐾💞🌸🐝🦔🍀🎼🖼 (@LotusB10) February 22, 2022 There’s a 100% non recidivism humane way to deter problem bears – it was done for sometime on collared bears in Glacier National Park – Dart – collar- track & the next time he goes near a house,tree him w leashed Karelian bear Hunting dogs & pop him in the behind w rubberbullets — Daryl Hannah (@dhlovelife) February 21, 2022 This can’t turn into Harambe 2.0. We can’t afford another rift in the timeline — FascistFinder (@fascist_finder) February 21, 2022 Please don’t kill Hank the Tank! Humane solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts EXIST. We’re offering to help Lake Tahoe officials find the bear a home at a wonderful sanctuary instead of capturing & killing him. https://t.co/H0jDGgYm6L — PETA (@peta) February 24, 2022 This is ‘Hank the Tank,’ a 500-lb black bear suspected of terrorizing a Lake Tahoe neighborhood. pic.twitter.com/gWciwDiq9e — NowThis (@nowthisnews) February 23, 2022 I’m literally loving the Hank the Tank storyline. I’d invite that bear in for dinner — poltergeisha (@francisfacade) February 24, 2022 In an appeal to save the bear, a Twitter user said, “Please don’t hurt Hank. The misconception is that he’s fine due his size but bears should be hibernating through winter. Hence, it may be the climate isn’t conducive; he’s awake, and hungry now.”']
