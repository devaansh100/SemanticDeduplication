Madhya Pradesh followed Maharashtra closely and registered the demise of 46 spotted felines in the same duration. Unnatural reasons like poaching (102), road hits (47), killed by villagers (22), shot dead (5) and electrocution (2) emerged as prominent causes behind the disappearing leopards, said the report. Among other causes, infighting with tigers also caused 25 deaths of leopards in this duration. Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.']
