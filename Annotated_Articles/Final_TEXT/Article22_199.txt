The highly decomposed carcass of the cub was found on Monday.Pench field director and conservator of forests (CF) Sreelakshmi Annabathula said the cub was one among the three siblings of T6 (female tiger in Paoni) last sighted by a group of tourists on March 25. Since then, only two cubs were sighted with the mother.Sreelakshmi said, “An intensive search led to the carcass of the cub on Monday in compartment number 306. We cross-checked the camera trap pictures and have found that a leopard is also moving in the same area. We suspect the cub was killed by the leopard.”According to Bhandara veterinarian Gunwant Bhadke and Dr Sujit Kolangath from Wildlife Research and Training Centre, there were two puncture wounds on the neck of the cub, indicating that it was killed by a big carnivore.This is the 11th tiger death in Maharashtra this year.
