['Black Bear cubs of 2022 update\nDuring the past week, the cubs in the Center’s LMI enclosure have continued to gain weight. As of June 2, weights were: Black Bear cub #22-0462: 9.0 kg Black Bear cub #22-0685: 5.25 kg Black Bear cub #22-1087: 3.0 kg The smallest cub, female #22-1087, is now large enough to live in one of the main Large Mammal Isolation enclosures. The Center also admitted two more cubs in the past few days – Black Bear cub #22-1448 [Double Orange] is a healthy male cub that is well-matched in size for Black Bear cub #22-0462. These two will live together in the left side of the Large Mammal enclosure. The two smaller cubs -- #0685 and #1087 – will live in the right side of the Large Mammal enclosure. This way, the cubs can continue to see and smell each other, but they are separated for now due to the large size difference. Another recent cub admission, Black Bear cub #22-1376, has a fractured humerus and will need to remain in a Zinger crate immediately after his June 2 surgery.']
