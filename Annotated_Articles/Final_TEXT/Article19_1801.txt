['Cat Holocaust: Australia Is Set To Kill Millions Of Feral Stray Cats By Air-Dropping Poisonous Sausages\nThe Australian government is in the spotlight for its plan to kill two million feral cats by 2020 by use of poison-laced sausages to reduce the island\'s wild cat population. These feral cats are the same as house cats just that they live and hunt in the wild without any human contact. According to several scientific studies, these cats are responsible for the extinction of more than two dozen of island nation’s native species. The cats die within 15 minutes after eating the sausages made with kangaroo meat, chicken fat, herbs, spices and the poison. Representational Image Planes distributing the poisoned sausages, drop 50 sausages every kilometre in areas where the cats roam free. Australia’s Department of the Environment and Energy in 2015 unveiled its threatened species strategy, which included four main pillars: reducing the feral cat population, establishing safe havens for at-risk species, improving habitats and carrying out emergency interventions for species facing extinction, reported ABC7News. The news did not go down well with many people as many termed it as "cat holocaust", urging the government to find an alternative way: Terrible! Australians are down with a cat holocaust.

Not to be confused with the Great Emu War of 1932. pic.twitter.com/bY3m2Nc6HP — Amanda (@TheCompleteFool) April 27, 2019 Dr Dave Algar, who developed the recipe for poison, said he had used cats to test the taste of sausages before adding poison to check the flavour. "They\'ve got to taste good,” he told the New York Times. “They are the cat\'s last meal."']
