['6 Animal Rights Laws in India that everyone must know about!\nAnimal lovers in India who feed or care for stray animals face incredible hostility since stray animals are viewed as a threat. People fail to recognise that silent animals are living beings that experience the same level of anguish and sadness as people, if not more. The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, has certain provisions in favour of the voiceless and those who try to improve the welfare of these creatures. Section 11 (i) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 says that abandoning an animal, leaving it in a situation where it suffers pain due to starvation or thirst, is a punishable offence. A fine of up to ₹50 may be imposed in this situation. If the same act is committed again within three years, the offender faces a fine of between ₹25 and ₹100, or up to three months in jail, or both. Clearly, neither the fine nor the jail is a sufficient deterrent to persons who mistreat animals.
