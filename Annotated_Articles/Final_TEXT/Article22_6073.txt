Three accused were arrested.“In both the cases, the leopards died of electrocution and both the places lie in revenue areas. Three accused were arrested in previous case and two have been arrested now”, district forest officer Satna, Vipin Patel told TOI.He added, “We are constantly keeping a vigil in the forest areas and water bodies too, both the incidents have been reported from tribal villages. It is probably a part of culture that if there is a marriage or any such ceremony meat of forest animals is prepared and these electric wires are probably set for killing other forest animals for the feast, even in the recent case, a marriage ceremony was scheduled a day later. Though these wires are laid for killing other animals, leopards accidentally get trapped. We are creating awareness and are also co-ordinating with electricity department to ensure such incidents are not repeated”, he said.']
