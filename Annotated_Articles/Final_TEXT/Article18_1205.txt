According to the officials, the big cat was tranquilized on Wednesday. Veterinary experts who tended to the tigress found a wire around her neck, removed it and administered required medication, they said. “The injured tigress was first caught in a camera trap on April 7. Once it was ascertained that she was injured, we launched a search operation to track her. The team eventually tranquilized her some three kilometres away from the camera site. The veterinary experts administered her the required medical treatment,” said Badhawan, who is in-charge of Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Bahraich. The big cat was kept in a cage for a few hours and once she regained consciousness, she was released in her habitat in the Katarniaghat Sanctuary, the officer said. The forest department also launched an operation to clear the forest of snares and warned of strict action against anyone found involved in poaching activities in the area.
