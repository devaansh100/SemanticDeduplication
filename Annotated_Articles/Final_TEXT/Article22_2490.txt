['Carnivore Confusion\nShut up or you\'re next! There\'s an unspoken awkward issue in fiction involving Talking Animals. If everyone can talk, and everyone at least implicitly has the same thoughts and feeling as everyone else regardless of species, does this mean predatory creatures are forced to engage in a form of murder to eat? Or is it more like cannibalism? And then what happens when human characters are added into the mix? Works of fiction will address this in one of several ways: See also Super-Persistent Predator, Let\'s Meet the Meat, Ascended to Carnivorism, and I Taste Delicious. Compare Furry Confusion, Cats Are Mean, Reptiles Are Abhorrent (notice that small lizards and turtles, two groups that include herbivores, get to be non-abhorrent far more frequently than snakes, which are all carnivores), and What Measure Is a Non-Cute?. As with What Measure is a Non Cute, do not expect to see realistic animal behavior taken into account. When it\'s between a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire and a human, it\'s Warm Bloodbags Are Everywhere. Things get really ugly when I\'m a Humanitarian gets thrown into the mix. Examples of Carnivore Confusion include:   Anime and Manga Kimba the White Lion has played a bit with this problem (despite being guilty of this trope itself in early episodes): after all animals make peace under the new "lion king", they are suddenly facing a situation where no-one is allowed to eat anyone else, thus reducing their entire carnivore population to live solely on insect (and even THAT gives them moral qualms; lucky that a man who\'s been trying to invent "artificial meat" eventually comes along...) has played a bit with this problem (despite being guilty of this trope itself in early episodes): after all animals make peace under the new "lion king", they are suddenly facing a situation where no-one is allowed to eat anyone else, thus reducing their entire carnivore population to live solely on insect (and even THAT gives them moral qualms; lucky that a man who\'s been trying to invent "artificial meat" eventually comes along...) Pokémon brings up this trope sometimes, albeit rarely. In the series, all animals -and even several plants- are Pokémon, and all Pokémon are intelligent. The cast has indeed been seen eating meat and the early games directly address this at points - Farfetch\'d and Lapras are said to be near-extinct due to overhunting, and Pokémon Gold and Silver has you rescuing Slowpoke from Team Rocket...who are harvesting their tails for sale as delicacies. (They grow back, but...). In the first season of the anime, curiously, there were a few non-Pokémon fish, but they\'ve been pretty much retconned out of existence. (Much of this was before there was a Pokémon equivalent of almost everything you can think of.) Most of the characters seem to prefer to never talk about such things and enjoy the meal, including the Pokémon. Actually, there are real animals in the Pokémon world, they were just not brought up very often. In the games Raichu is described as being able to knock out an elephant and Bellsprout eats insects according to their Pokédex entries. But they also have Pokémon food...and berries can be fed to any Pokémon... In one episode, James has a Magikarp, which is basically a very big koi. They narrowly escaped a sunken ship, and are starving on a makeshift raft in the middle of the ocean. Everyone wants a taste of the juicy Magikarp, except Misty who has a soft spot for Water-types. The only reason Magikarp survived was because its scales were too hard to bite through. Nobody seemed to care that Magikarp was alive . [3] In an episode featuring Farfetch\'d, the Pokédex states that the bird is best served with the leek it carries as a weapon. brings up this trope sometimes, albeit rarely.

The gamesag and cards specifically cite references of Pokémon eating each other; Ekans have clearly been stated to eat other Pokémon eggs. According to Pokémon Silver, Furret eat Rattata, and according to one of the TCG cards Omastar is a predator that cracked open Shellder shells and sucked out their insides. Sneasel specifically targets the eggs of Pidgey, who in turn love to eat Magikarp, Wurmple developed poison to fight off Swellow, who still manage to eat many Wurmple anyway. Thankfully, Pokémon you\'ve caught won\'t try to eat each other. Metagross, despite being one of the smartest, and probably closest to sentient of most Pokémon, is described as a brutal predator which may eat anything smaller than its mouth (actually seeing its mouth in 3D was a letdown). Diglett scavenge off of Onix\'s catches. Some Pokédex entries do refer to Venonat eating bugs, but this is probably due to there being no Pokémon small enough for it to eat. Other Pokémon like Gengar can simply feed off of emotions like fear, but it\'s a Ghost. It\'s hard to find at least one Pokédex for a species that doesn\'t mention the word "prey". Pokédex entries in the games do mention actual places and animals, so the meat coming from actual animals is not out of the question. In the Pokémon manga The Electric Tale of Pikachu , there is a section were Ash and Pikachu get lured by a Clefairy into an Onix\'s nest, where Ash suggests that it wants to eat them. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl tackle the issue head on, in the Canalave library there is a book with an ancient legend that states that if you pick the bones of a Pokémon clean then throw it to the sea it will come back to life. Another one also mentions a foolish young warrior who goes around striking down any Pokémon he came across with a sword. All animals in Nagasarete Airantou can talk, so humans eat fish instead. Eggs are still fair game, though, making it a little awkward when a hen has a friendly chat with the male lead before handing over a basket of her, well, periods. can talk, so humans eat fish instead.

Arashi no Yoru ni (One Stormy Night) is a heartwarming anime movie about a clumsy, mangy wolf named Gabu making friends with a sweet (if somewhat androgynous) goat named Mei. The wolf repeatedly had to suppress the urge to eat him and his kind, which his goat friend is blissfully unaware off (unlike his more wise nervous friends). For example, while going out on a picnic, Gabu loses his meal and (delirious with hunger) thinks about gnawing off Mei\'s ear under the assumption that friends should make others happy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5gaQMpOcw Even more heartbreakingly, At one point, the two get stuck in the snow together. There is no grass around, so Mei will almost certainly not make it back home alive. There is no prey for Gabu to eat, either...except Mei, that is. Gabu refuses to listen at first, but when Mei points out that he might be able to live if he eats him, and that Mei will almost certainly die anyway, he reluctantly sees things his way, though not at all happily. Luckily, they find a way out without having to resort to that. Honestly, the whole movie could be seen as a Deconstruction/Reconstruction of the trope.

Averted in Wolf\'s Rain , where in spite of the wolves\' ability to replenish energy by sleeping in the moonlight, it\'s clearly no substitute for actual food. Kiba mentions having gone a month with only moonlight to sustain him, and consequently is much thinner than the others. They find a decomposing deer carcass in one of the early episodes (which everyone but Hige turns down, generally because it\'s rotting ). After Toboe\'s Crowning Moment of Awesome where he kills the giant walrus, they eat the walrus—and in a surprisingly dignified acknowledgment, the walrus says something along the lines of, "You may have killed me, but I have saved you all." , where in spite of the wolves\' ability to replenish energy by sleeping in the moonlight, it\'s clearly no substitute for actual food.

In the manga Wa!, there\'s a scene in which Those Two Girls engage in a Seinfeldian Conversation which quickly turns into Conversational Troping regarding this trope and Furry Confusion.

Ms. Spider: Excuse... Lambert The Sheepish Lion: A Disney short where a stork accidently delivers a lion to a family of sheep. It\'s never questioned how Lambert survives without eating the other sheep. In one scene he saves his foster mother from an evil, hungry wolf.   Film Ice Age plays it rather straight. Sid and Manny find a human baby, and decide to take it to the adults. The whole reason the baby got separated was because of an attack by saber-toothed cats, and the cats still want the baby. Enter Diego, who promises to help Sid and Manny deliver the baby to the tribe. They don\'t trust him, and for good reason. Throughout the film, nobody trusts Diego, and he threatens to eat Sid on several occasions. Indeed, the whole reason he\'s helping them is to deliver to his pack so he can eat them. He does a Heel Face Turn, and saves them from the pack. This is all well and good, makes for a happy ending, but the hell is Diego supposed to eat? Diego\'s group of Sabre-tooths respected humans as fellow hunters; they were originally just after the human baby in revenge for the humans killing one of the sabre-tooths first; they weren\'t after it as a snack, per se, but only in retaliation. Apparently if Diego just told them this, then Manny could have told him that the baby\'s mother was already dead, and Diego could go just home since they were even. Ah, but Soto wanted the baby , not the mother. And at the end of the first movie, and throughout the entire second movie, Diego is seen happily hanging out with the sloth and the mammoth. Either he\'s fine with never eating again, or they just look the other way when he kills and devours their friends. The first movie did explicitly state that Manny doesn\'t mind animals that kill for food. The second movie also raises an interesting question when the characters talk about having a pet. Either slavery is perfectly kosher, or there are animals that are of lesser intelligence than what is generally seen. There are. One\'s named Rudy, which also falls under the Predators Are Mean depiction (which the T-Rexes also follow - mute, only the young ones can be called "cute" - but are portrayed sympathetically). Actually, Rudy seems to have been as smart as the T-Rex (which was portrayed as semi-sentient, being able to understand the mammals\' language although the adults appear unable to speak it. In addition Rudy has, at least on some occasions during the final battle, appeared to understand speech, seeing as how he nurtured a grudge with Buck. Also in the third movie, Diego was shown hunting a sort of deer, one that could definitely talk and mocked him when he lost, so apparently he kept eating meat after befriending the herbivores. Of course there are animals of lower intelligence. Look at Sid. The third movie also parodies the vegan carnivore option by having Sid try to teach baby T-Rexes to eat fruit. When the real mother drops off a piece of meat for her offspring, they instinctively devour it, prompting a smug smile from her. plays it rather straight.

In Shark Tale , Lenny the Shark, a principled vegetarian who refuses to devour sapient creatures, and massive disappointment to his father, makes an unsuccessful attempt to eat a sobbing shrimp who begs for his life. And in a clear case of You Fail Biology Forever, when he wants to look harmless to the fish population, he dresses up as a dolphin , even though fish are the food of choice for dolphins (Can you say "Dolphin Safe Tuna"?). It seems only sharks are afraid of dolphins. Yes, the badass predators of the deep are terrified of a dolphin, but the small little fishies don\'t even bat an eye. (OK, in real life, dolphins have been known to battle sharks that stray too close to their pods, but...) In the shark\'s defense there, Dolphins do kill for fun. They\'ll even kill their own kind when bored, so it might be under the same attitude of a legitimate championship hunter fearing a serial killer. Didn\'t the MythBusters successfully repel a great white with a fake dolphin? , Lenny the Shark, a principled vegetarian who refuses to devour sapient creatures, and massive disappointment to his father, makes an unsuccessful attempt to eat a sobbing shrimp who begs for his life. In Happy Feet , the penguins themselves eat fish, which are rendered realistically. The pair of orcas encountered during the film are also treated realistically; as playful, giant dolphins that try to eat the protagonists. The Skua that try unsuccessfully to feed on juvenile penguins talk, and are depicted like bullies or gangsters. A leopard seal can speak and is treated like an intelligent, evil monster, akin to a dragon. Top this off with heavy, Anvilicious doses of Humans Are the Real Monsters and you\'ve got yourself a very mixed bag on predator treatment. In the sequel, the krill are able to talk (though not to the penguins) and realize how much life sucks on the bottom of the food-chain. , the penguins themselves eat fish, which are rendered realistically.

As an excellent example of the "Predators Are Mean" subtrope, the otherwise sweet and cutesy-wootsy Once Upon a Forest has a Nightmare Fuel ready scene in which the anthropomorphic-to-the-extreme (except for size) heroes are menaced by a terrifying, non-anthro owl. Um, hm... At least in the PC game, the owl spoke.

In the book sequel, Rasco And The Rats Of Nimh , the Owl nearly kills Timothy Frisby by snatching him up to eat until he realizes that Timothy is Mrs. Frisby\'s son. Timothy is really, really hurt badly. Additionally, the only film that plays Cats Are Mean even heavier is... An American Tail , also by Bluth.

Incredibly epic fail in Pride which shows a vegan lioness doing pretty well until both plant and animal are depleted in the \'badlands\' area where she lives after running away from her parents for them trying to force her to obey her carnivorous nature.

Some viewers have pointed out that actual pigs will eat practically anything given to them, but one would think a humanoid, intelligent, sapient pig would know better. Literature We always do a crappy job telling the story. We can never make people understand what it\'s like or why John kept eating that screaming hamburger, down to the last bite.   Live-Action TV Subverted, handwaved and lampshaded a lot in various Muppet productions, usually involving the Swedish Chef: In an episode of The Muppet Show the Chef tried to make a Thanksgiving dinner. Trying to make turkey doesn\'t work since the turkeys can talk; trying to make pig stew is as bad, with pigs in the cast. He goes for "veggy weggy stew" but the vegetables can talk and fight him. In the concluding scene the Thanksgiving dinner consists entirely of vitamin pills . In another episode he tried to boil a Lobster until the Lobster\'s brothers rode in Mexican-Bandito style, shooting up the kitchen with their revolvers and rescuing the main course. He had a similar problem making Christmas dinner for A Muppet Family Christmas . The Chef invited the Turkey (from Dorchester, MA) for dinner. The Turkey convinces the Chef to roast up Big Bird instead. Big Bird unwittingly saves his own life by befriending the Chef, and in the words of this reviewer, "The Chef ends up preparing shredded wheat and cranberry sauce, which is terrific. Until the cranberries start singing \'Silent Night\'..." In The Muppet Christmas Carol , Rizzo the Rat is about to eat some vegetables prepared by the Swedish Chef...but they join in song, and he shakes his head and relates his mother\'s advice: "Never eat singing food." Then there was the frog\'s legs skit, the duck soup episode...once his spaghetti tried to crawl away from the plate while he was checking on the tomato sauce, and ended up attacking him when he slapped it back. Another time, bread dough started inflating and finally took him over. And each and every time it was absolutely hilarious. In Muppet Treasure Island , Mrs Bubberidge the innkeeper announces tomorrow\'s special is "roast suckling..." and when the appalled pigs turn to her, she concludes "...potatoes". And then she has to apologise to a talking potato ... In the Julie Andrews episode number The Lonely Goatherd , one must wonder what the lonely goat herded (especially since no flock was shown on screen). Well, no wonder he was lonely! Averted altogether on Sesame Street , where the issue is simply avoided. When Elmo inquired about what wild animals eat, he was told about herbivores and insectivores, but meat-eaters were never discussed, even though (talking) tiger and lion Muppets were right next to him. in various Muppet productions, usually involving the Swedish Chef: In Dinosaurs , everyone (except, ironically, humans) acts like people, which means the characters will frequently have conversations with their meals. , everyone (except, ironically, humans) acts like people, which means the characters will frequently have conversations with their meals. There was a Tales from the Darkside episode called "Your Weight Is Over" that took this concept to the very extreme. A malevolent "diet company" gave a woman the power to hear food talking. Any food, vegetable, or animal. So whenever she bit in, it screamed. She starved to death in the end. Puzzling, in as much as fruits (and many so-called vegetables, such as tomatoes and eggplant) are not whole organisms; they are in effect fertilized ovaries, deliberately cast off by a plant in order to facilitate its reproduction. Even if you pluck an apple from a tree instead of waiting for it to fall, you\'re not killing (or indeed hurting) anything. The seeds are designed to pass through an animal digestive tract unharmed and viable. If you think about that too hard, especially in the context of sentient apple trees, you get a whole different kind of Squick (see Equal Rites ). Processed meat certainly wouldn\'t be able to speak, either, so both must just be a trick. Fresh vegetables can feel "pain" much better than processed meat. Animals feel pain via nerve cells, which are dead at that point. The vegetable\'s equivalent damage-recognition system (which is based on hormone changes and cell membrane voltage) is fully functioning while it\'s fresh. Of course, vegetables do not have central nervous systems to process the sensation, so the point is moot unless you have an aversion to damaging food in general. episode called "Your Weight Is Over" that took this concept to the very extreme. A malevolent "diet company" gave a woman the power to hear food talking. Any food, vegetable, or animal. So whenever she bit in, it screamed. She starved to death in the end. An especially odd example: During one of his Headlines segments, Jay Leno showed a newspaper article with tips for a fun camp-out. The picture for the article showed three anthropomorphic marshmallows roasting an inanimate marshmallow over a fire. Nightmare Fuel, indeed... Possibly the most disturbing (and, yes, Nightmare Fuel) variation of this trope: TV Funhouse . The whole show is basically a satire of kid\'s shows. Except for one human, most of the cast are animals. Some of the animals are played by puppets, others by actual animals. In one episode, all the animals went to this restaurant where the whole gimmick was that you eat what you are. The cats can eat cats, lobsters eat lobsters, and so on. Get ready for this, because I\'m leading up to the disturbing part, which will be the very last three words of this entry. Remember, some of the animals were played by puppets, and others were played by real animals. And the theme of the restaurant was that you eat your own species. Well, they had a real life pig, and real food, and they showed the pig eating bacon. Pigs are omnivorous and happily eat anything. It\'s not disturbing that they fed a pig bacon, as non-sapient creatures have no morals to have qualms with cannibalism, anymore than the rest of the scene is disturbing. And among livestock, pigs are infamous for cannibalism, especially eating their own young. So you know that bit at the beginning of The Wizard of Oz where Dorothy falls into the pigpen and everyone panics? The reason for that is because it\'s fairly common for pigs to eat their keepers if given the opportunity. A pig eating bacon is barely a squick. Also, in case you weren\'t aware of this, there are plenty of animal farms that feed suet (leftover bonemeal and unedible or unwanted animal parts) back to the animals. In some countries this is illegal or at least restricted (e.g. feed cow suet to the pigs, pig suet to the cows, or somesuch). The main reason to avoid this (like cannibalism, aside from the moral implications) is that same-species feeding makes it easier to contract diseases from the food. Just because something sick and wrong is common, does not stop it being SICK AND WRONG. Forget the pig eating bacon...in one episode Robert Goulet accompanied them to the restaurant and, presumably, had some long pork chops. . The whole show is basically a satire of kid\'s shows.

On Arrested Development the Bluths\' Frozen Banana stand has as its mascot Mr. Banana Grabber, a giant talking banana that steals and eats regular-sized, non-talking bananas. The implications are not lost on Michael. Michael: Why would a banana grab another banana? I mean, those are the kind of questions I don\'t want to answer. In a rather silly Did Not Do the Research case, Animal Planet\'s Weird, True and Freaky featured a story on chimpanzee "cannibalism." Anyone familiar with chimps knows that the males tend to kidnap and eat the infants of rival troops. Shocking, yes, but that\'s not what the story is about. It\'s about chimpanzees, apes, hunting for monkey meat. And the narrator says it\'s cannibalism. That\'s just about as cannibalistic as a polar bear eating a seal! It also reaches Unfortunate Implications, as many people in Africa regularly eat bushmeat (see the real life examples below)   Newspaper Comics Pogo played around with this trope a lot, especially in its earlier days. The animals went back and forth between viewing carnivorism as no big deal ("I dunno, Pogo...sounds kinda good.") and treating it as cannibalism. The prime example here is Albert the Alligator, who in the early days of the comic would sometimes end up swallowing smaller animals by accident (they were usually saved, though) and would sometimes be accused of eating someone if they went missing. He\'d sometimes threaten to eat the small critters if they annoyed him, and at one point even chased after the villains with a knife and fork, as revenge when they\'d tried to eat Pogo—but he never actually went through with it. He pretty much stopped doing this in the comic\'s later years, but he\'d still cheerfully mooch off his friends and eating their food. The villains of the comic were more openly carnivorous, especially Wiley Catt and Seminole Sam, who would at times try to cook and eat the smaller animals, such as Pogo. The other characters would (in addition to cakes, biscuits and other types of snack food) eat fish, who were mostly portrayed as non-sentient...though in one very early story, Pogo and Howland Owl are getting into a discussion while fishing, resulting in the same fish getting pulled in and out of the water a number of times...until it asks, in an annoyed tone: "Is you fishin\' or just hossin\' around? Make up yo\' minds! I ain\'t got all day!" played around with this trope a lot, especially in its earlier days. The animals went back and forth between viewing carnivorism as no big deal ("I dunno, Pogo...sounds kinda good.") and treating it as cannibalism. In a Far Side strip, a chicken serves her bedridden husband a bowl of soup, saying, "Quit complaining and eat it! First of all, chicken soup is good for a cold, and second, it\'s nobody we know." Gary Larson seemed fond of exposing this trope. One strip has a cow saying to her friends "Hey, we really DO taste like chicken" after trying a hamburger; another has the cow\'s friends saying "You\'re SICK, Jessie! Sick, sick, sick!" while said cow is running a barbecue grill. Funny at age 12, rather disturbing now... The Far Side also features the animal addiction-recovery organization "Maneaters Anonymous". This idea is used in the same darkly humorous fashion in a Robot Chicken segment, where two bulls munch slowly on hamburgers made from their friend and commend how good he tastes. The illustrated short story There\'s A Hair In My Dirt! by the same author, is an especially brutal mockery of this trope. The \'beautiful forest maiden\' Harriet, on her way home from a stroll through the forest, encounters a snake attacking a mouse. She grabs a big stick and bashes the big bad vicious snake to death, then cuddles the poor helpless little mouse until it recovers, upon which she releases it back into the meadow. Good having triumphed over evil, the forest is now a safer place for all woodland creatures! Well...not quite. Turns out the mouse was carrying deadly diseases . As mice tend to do...which is why it\'s actually a good thing that snakes keep the population in check. And so \'one fine spring morning Harriet, delirious with fever, stumbled out of her little cottage, fell over, and died.\' There was a series of full-page color strips from Cows of Our Planet , and every age of evolution includes at least one cow-thing, leading to the future, where the whole world is ruled by cows.

The straight version is played deliberately for laughs in Sherman\'s Lagoon , as part of its championship of \'uncute\' critters: the two starring sharks eat other anthropomorphic fish regularly, usually after chatting for awhile. They also frequently go after humans —which they call "hairless beach apes"—as well, \'fishing\' for them using lines cast onto the beach. Numerous strips discuss the best baits for the various types of human. , as part of its championship of \'uncute\' critters: the two starring sharks eat other anthropomorphic fish regularly, usually after chatting for awhile.

Played straight in Pearls Before Swine ...except that the predator crocs are altogether too stupid to catch their prey, Zebra, even though he lives right next door. They survive in the meanwhile by devouring fried chicken and other fast food. They doubled the fun when some lions moved into the house on the other side of Zebra and the wives are very competent hunters. Fortunately for Zebra, the lions went through a divorce and the husband scored big in the settlement. Got both the house and the wives have to ship a crate of meat each week. Genius Bonus: Male lions don\'t hunt. Lionesses do all the work, and then the males bull in and take their fill (giving us a literal grounding in the phrase "lion\'s share"); the females and cubs can take from what\'s left when the males are done. Pig apparently really likes bacon. He was kicked out of the Pig Fraternity for enjoying BLTs, which gave the first Pearls collection its title. ...except that the predator crocs are altogether too stupid to catch their prey, Zebra, even though he lives right next door.

In Garfield , Garfield has eaten (or tried to) birds, fish, and flowers that are often shown to be as intelligent as he is even after holding conversations with them, and also has no compunctions whatsoever about squashing talking spiders (and their grieving families.) For the most part, Garfield will eat anything but mice, established within the first week of the strip\'s creation. ("Show me a good mouser, and I\'ll show you a cat with bad breath.") He also abhors spinach (especially cooked spinach) and raisins (even in cookies). A certain strip has Garfield facing the ghosts of all the animals he\'s eaten, including what looks like a cow or a horse . (It\'s probably meant to be a cow [beef lasagna], given its split hooves, although if he\'s ever actually eaten cat food, a horse might be possible as well.) Meanwhile, the protagonists of U.S. Acres are herbivores, with predatory animals appearing only as villains, unless you count Booker\'s fruitless pursuit of a worm which sometimes appears more intelligent than he is—although, in "The Worm Turns", Sheldon the ambulatory egg mentions that he\'s planning to have quiche for dinner... The front cover of Vol. 4 has Garfield about to have two eggs sunny-side up (truly a meal of epic proportions), when he sees that Booker, wings crossed and glaring at him, is standing there with Sheldon.

Wagner from the Finnish newspaper comic Viivi & Wagner is an anthropomorphic pig - whose favorite foods include bacon and ham.   Tabletop Games AD&D Planescape Kings of the Wild accessory: The creatures of Beastland hunt and eat each other - c\'est la vie . Because the possibility of being devoured by Owl is just part of what it means to be Mouse. Moreover, to kill an animal without subsequently eating it is "the ultimate insult" to the whole species (and possibly all other species under the same Beast Lord\'s rule). "Predators Are Mean" was invoked once, and even this ultimately was the stupid mortals\' fault. Initially at least the Beast Lords themselves (who can assume humanoid form) were exempt from the menu, but times changed. On the other hand, Mouse Lord, being the ultimate "sneaky rodent", is so good at hiding and escaping that only Owl Lord can hunt him down. Unknown if it\'s been retconned since or not, but the Beastlands had a sort of \'Valhalla-esque\' vibe - anything that died there(whether eaten or not) would revive the next day. Thus Mouse Lord being eaten by Owl Lord isn\'t so much utterly destroyed as inconvenienced for a few hours, maybe a day. You mean eaten alive then inconvenienced for a few hours? accessory: The creatures of Beastland hunt and eat each other - .

Subverted in the Ravenloft setting\'s domain of the Wildlands, where all the Talking Animals have a mean streak regardless of ecological niche. the Talking Animals have a mean streak regardless of ecological niche. Also AD&D Example but not involving animals, its quite common for Exclusively Evil Races to eat anything not their race, like Giants, Orcs or Goblins. On a more horrifying extent, Illithids even breed and enslave Anything That Moves as tasty snacks and workforce. Also in one Novel its stated that humans make bad slaves for drow, because they are way to prone for rebelliousness, but they are quite useful for trade connections or if you run low on other food... The Lunar Exalted in Exalted have the innate ability to assume the form of animals. They acquire new forms by killing an animal of the appropriate species (presumably after hunting it down themselves) and drinking its fresh blood in a very literal case of "you are what you eat".

Averted in the "furry RPG" Ironclaw, where only mammals and birds are anthropomorphic, leaving reptiles (lizards, dinosaurs, dragons) as the beasts of burden and livestock.   Theater Taken to the extreme in Thorbjörn Egner\'s Dyrene i Hakkebakkeskogen (The Animals Of Hakkebakke Forest), one of Norway\'s most popular children\'s plays ever. By popular vote, the animals pass a law banning carnivorism. One of the animals who supports the law is the alpha bear (brown bears admittedly eating plants for 80% of their diet), while one of the animals who opposes it is a hedgehog (which eats invertebrates and small vertebrates). Carnivorism is played much like alcoholism here too, as the fox, who had been the main antagonist up to this point, turns to stealing meat from the nearest farm to get his "fix".

Video Games Web-based pet sims often have this problem. For example, carnivorous Neopets can and do eat other Neopets (a specific example is the abandon with which lupes eat chias), despite all of them being sentient. Like Pokémon , there used to be "normal" animals such as fish and cows to give milk but, except for some outdated materials such as items of encyclopedia pages, this practice is being phased out. , there used to be "normal" animals such as fish and cows to give milk but, except for some outdated materials such as items of encyclopedia pages, this practice is being phased out. Beyond Good and Evil has anthropomorphic pigs, cows, and goats, among others...and a freezer area full of rotting beef. And a place called the Slaughterhouse. And Pey\'j, a pig, seems to be the subject of several jokes about being eaten. Pey\'j: Thanks, Jade...if it weren\'t for you, I would\'ve ended up on a plate with an apple in my mouth! Jade: Cut it out. You\'re making me hungry! Since you handily collect species information about every animal in the game, it\'s worth noting that Pey\'j is "Sus sapiens" (wise pig), parallel to "Homo sapiens" (wise man). So it\'s reasonable to guess that regular animals and their anthropomorphic analogs are completely different species and that it\'s fine to eat the non-intelligent kinds. There\'s also an anthropomorphic shark who brags about his ability to devour "a family of five" in record time, along with his family\'s achievements in this area. A family of five what is never addressed. In the Super Mario Bros. series, the Mushroom Kingdom is mainly inhabited by anthropomorphic mushrooms like Toad. Then in the Paper Mario games, it\'s discovered that normal mushrooms are also the Mushroom Kingdom\'s main food source! And there\'s also a pig who runs a hot dog stand... Remember that this is the Paper Mario series, so it\'s probably deliberate. Mario is friends with Toad, stomps Goombas, and eats big mushrooms and 1up\'s. It\'s never explicitly stated they\'re mushrooms; the Super Mario Brothers Super Show depicted them as midgets with no noses and mushroom hats. If this is true to the series, then the residents of the Bean Bean kingdom aren\'t beans who eat beans, they\'re green people who love eating beans. It makes sense that they\'re humans when you consider Peach is a human, as well as the fact that her Grand Mother was a Toad in SMRPG. series, the Mushroom Kingdom is mainly inhabited by anthropomorphic mushrooms like Toad. Then in the games, it\'s discovered that normal mushrooms are also the Mushroom Kingdom\'s main food source! And there\'s also a pig who runs a hot dog stand... Spore pretty much averts this entirely—as a Carnivore or Omnivore creature, you can socialize with the same creatures you are capable of killing and eating. The same holds true in the Tribal stage, and any other tribes don\'t seem to mind if you\'re slaughtering other sapient creatures and consuming them. (Not averted so much if you\'re playing Tribal as a straight carnivore and offer a gift basket of meat to a tribe of herbivores...) pretty much averts this entirely—as a Carnivore or Omnivore creature, you can socialize with the same creatures you are capable of killing and eating.

(Not averted so much if you\'re playing Tribal as a straight carnivore and offer a gift basket of meat to a tribe of herbivores...) Animal Crossing, being Animal Crossing, totally avoids this. At least, for 364 days of the year. The sole exception is the "Harvest Festival", wherein everyone in town gathers at the wishing well for a great big Thanksgiving-esque dinner with no turkey. The only food there seems to be stuffing, vegetables, and the like...with the exception of one big, empty platter. As it turns out, the "guest of honor", a turkey named Franklin, has been in hiding ever since he got a letter from the mayor. Franklin: "We cordially invite you to be the main guest at our annual Harvest Festival. Heh heh heh hoorf..." What\'s wrong with that?!? I can even see where the word "dish" was erased and then replaced with "guest!"   Web Comics Web Original   Western Animation   Real Life Truth in Television. Most animals don\'t give a damn how we classify them, and will gladly eat other animals that are under similar classifications. Raptors eat smaller birds, fish will eat fish, and yes, most bird will peck whatever left over food you leave lying around, even chicken. Mammals eat other mammals all the time. Most humans eat pork and beef, which are both mammals similar to humans. Human meat was once known as long pig. Chicken farmers have to check the hen houses every day because if a egg sits too long and doesn\'t hatch, the hen will eat it, and like the taste so much she will eat every egg she lays from then on in. The "carnivores are mean" subtrope is so damn pervasive, wildlife centers and nature magazines are often deluged with calls and letters from hysterical bird lovers (really?) asking what can be done about the mean hawk eating all the poor little house sparrows. Seriously. For the record, backyard hawks and cats (don\'t forget that Cats Are Mean too) mostly go after Eurasian House Sparrows anyway. House Sparrows, for those not in the know, are an invasive species in the Americas who have wreaked havoc on native species. Fortunately they\'re so used to living around human houses for safety that they\'re almost too easy for predators to hunt. Speaking of backyard birds, this article, recently published in Audubon magazine, theorizes that one painting brought the Blue Jay of all animals under the Carnivores Are Mean banner. This isn\'t anything new for Corvids (poor crows; they\'re like the hyenas of the avian world), but it\'s weird that the one member of the family generally agreed to be the prettiest is under this big tent too. Paleoartist Mark Witton has brought this subject up for discussion in his online portfolio/blog. The discussion, which has been rather lively so far, accompanies his admittedly surprising illustration that depicts carnivorous scavenging behavior in ceratopsians. Even though he explains the thinking behind the piece, several posters can\'t quite wrap their heads around the idea of a meat-eating Styracosaur—which just underlines his point. This editorial, found (naturally) on the Failblog. Have you ever heard of David Pearce? The Abolitionist Project? This Tetrapod Zoology post will explain all. Or try to. "Mad Cow disease" became the issue it was, in the UK, thanks to the ground up remains of other animals being included in the feed for other cows, without the treatment that European feed got that destroyed the responsible prions. For that matter, some types of animal feeds have warnings about not feeding to other animals because of certain by-products. What is in fish food? Fish. Or at least, the parts that don\'t get sent to the shops or restaurants. This conveniently explains why it\'s so common for cats to sometimes eat the stuff. Then again, the food pyramid tends to be a lot taller in the sea than on land, allmost anything as large as a small fish or bigger is carnivorous. Perhaps the closest Real Life example not involving humans is the case of olive baboons, which sometimes play with baby vervet monkeys as infants. When fully grown, mobs of male olive baboons are quite happy to catch and eat the vervet monkeys who\'d been their childhood playmates. It\'s kinda the same with people who live on farms. Children sometimes play with the chickens and lambs and such...and then they get eaten. Of course, some are digusted/horrified at this, so refuse to eat them, which is normal. It isn\'t unheard of for a predator to become attached to another animal they\'re supposed to eat naturally. Of course, this usually doesn\'t mean they swear off eating the species, just the individual. There was a vegetarian lion once. Cows, deer, elk,pandas, elephants and hippos have all been observed and in some cases even filmed eating meat, which in the case of hippos sometimes included other hippos. Perhaps instead of thinking of these animals as strict vegetarians we should be thinking of them as mostly vegetarian? Polynesian dogs were used as food sources and were fed a vegetarian diet, as this article explains about the Hawaiian Poi Dog. How many of us have seen a BBQ restaurant with happy pig mascot, merrily serving up his kin on a bun for our dining pleasure? Try a BBQ restaurant with a happy live pig as its mascot. The pig lying content outside while its owners cook others of its species inside. Paul the Octopus, just imagine how would it feel being well-kept in captivity when many individuals of your keepers\' species happily eat other members of your species as a delicacy, and on top of that, half humans want to protect you and side with you and the other half want to cook and eat you for correctly "predicting" their team\'s loss in the FIFA World Cup 2010. The Spanish government even promised that should Spain emerge victorious of the World Cup final (as "predicted" by Paul the Octopus) the paella dish would not be served with octopus for a month . . While adult humans are (almost) immune to Carnivore Confusion, most children are horrified when they first learn (or figure out) where meat comes from. Even adults are not completely free from it - people tend to be squicked out by eating animal species that are, in the given culture, usual pet species or otherwise held in high regard. That\'s the reason people in the West often think that eating cats, dogs, parrots, small mammal pets, or horses is terrible (though horse is eaten in France), while it\'s perfectly fine to eat pigs, which are at least as intelligent as any of the above, and certainly more similar to humans socially. Pets are seen as part of the family. Pet species have been bred to become part of the family. The concept of someone eating dog or cat meat is akin to someone eating your adopted brother, sister, or kids. Universal prey species are generally immune from being thought of in such a manner because they\'re rarely kept as pets. Livestock such as cattle and pigs have been bred to be less intelligent and more tastey then their wild counterparts. Well, FYI guinea pigs were kept and bred for eating originally in South America (courtesy of The Other Wiki), so are we supposed to think that we "adopt a brother" just to plan to eat him later on originally? in most societies where cats and dogs are eaten, they aren\'t taken from someone, but are raised just for the purpose, similar to the reason I won\'t want to eat your dog... And about the bred for stupidity comment, when breading, the trait to look for is obedience rather than less in intelligence. The sheer notion that obedience=stupidity is totally human centric and doesn\'t make much sense in natural content. In my societies where cats and dogs are eaten, they aren\'t raised just for the purpose, but are taken (stolen) from someone (who raise them as pets and most often quite treasure them), since raising a cat or dog well is much harder than the profit it provides. Many people come to hate the food after their pets are stolen. There are semi-vegetarians who classify meat sources by how intelligent they are believed to be (although how accurate these beliefs are vary, especially as science marches on). There are many people who will eat fish but are squicked out by the thought of eating squid/octopus. In Western societies, the Great Apes are considered to be highly intelligent, and their close resemblence to humans make the idea of eating them seem to most people almost equivalent to cannibalism. This is far from the case in the regions of Africa where apes originate. There, they are commonly eaten—and referred to as "bush meat"—despite various laws and protective regulations forbidding the practice. The current best explanation of the origin of HIV/AIDS is that it mutated from SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus); and was first contracted through the practice of eating "bush meat", due to the physiological similarity between humans and apes. It\'s not unheard of for humans to end up in the "bush meat," too. Actually quite a few African cultures had cultural taboos against eating chimpanzees, bonobos, or gorillas. However, with all the wars, droughts, and economic depression that Africa has suffered in recent decades, many people have been forced to choose between either abandoning their taboos or starving.
