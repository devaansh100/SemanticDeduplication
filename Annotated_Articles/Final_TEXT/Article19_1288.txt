['Elderly Man Trampled To Death By Elephant In Dhenkanal\nDhenkanal: In yet another incident of elephant menace, an elderly man was trampled to death in the forest located in the Dihadol region of Dhenkanal on Monday. The deceased is identified as Nirottam Dehuri, a resident of Sogar village. He worked as a caretaker of a cashew farm in the midst of a jungle. On a morning at around 4am, when the victim was out in the field to defecate, was suddenly attacked by an elephant. He was lifted and thrown with the tusk and left dead on that field. The ranger and forest officer visited the site to look after the body and also reported it to the health sector. The ranger provided the family of the deceased with a cheque of Rs. 40,000 and also ensured remedial support. The fact that how was the permission granted to operate farms in the midst of a forest is a questionable matter. This incident also questions the credibility of work done by the forest department.']
