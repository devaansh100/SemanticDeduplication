Naveen, the 8-year-old son of Sohan Singh Rawat, a resident of Akhodi village, was going to attend a wedding with his grandmother near the village. He was walking ahead of his grandmother when suddenly a leopard attacked him at about 7:30 PM and dragged him to the nearby thick bushes. When the boy reached neither the wedding nor returned to the house, the family started searching for him and found his half-eaten body at around 9:30 PM among the bushes near the road. On being informed about the incident a team of the Forest department reached the spot and carried out an on-the-spot postmortem. The people of the village demanded that the department deploy hunters to kill the leopard after which two hunters Joy Hukil and Jagbeer Bhandari were deployed to shoot the leopard. The forest range officer Ashish Nautiyal said, “The immediate relief of Rs 15,000 has been provided to the victim’s family.”']
