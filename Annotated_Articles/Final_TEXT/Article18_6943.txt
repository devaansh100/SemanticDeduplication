The team went after it in a vehicle and sharp shooter Ajay Marathe darted the tiger with a tranquillizer shot, some 200 metres from Paryawaran Chowk.Soon after the tiger was sedated, it was caged. A source informed that the beast has been shifted to the transit treatment centre at Chandrapur.Chandrapur division DFO Prashant Khade confirmed the capture. “The operation to capture and remove the remaining tigers is in full swing. Further permission will be sought for capturing more tigers if they are found on CSTPS premises,” he said.The PCCF had issued the order to capture three tigers after people protested following following the killing of a contract worker by a tiger last week.Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports of sighting of a tiger near CISF barracks near administrative building as well as Officers’ Recreation Club of CSTPS late in the evening.Earlier in the day, district guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar directed authorities to remove all thorny shrubs from 5km area around the city that are providing shelter to the predators.In another development, demanding immediate remedial measures following increased predator threat in the area, Urjanagar-Durgapur Sangharsh Samiti has called for a bandh on Tuesday. A morcha will also be taken out to the collectorate.Wadettiwar held a meeting with district collector, SP, officials from forest department, CSTPS and WCL at Herai rest house of the power plant and reviewed the volatile conflict situation due to presence of high number of tigers and other predators in the suburbs of Chandrapur city.Expressing shock over eight human deaths in predator attacks in the last eight months in WCL and CSTPS areas on the outskirts of the city, the minister said, “There is complete lack of coordination among the related departments and officers were seen pointing fingers at each other. Citizens could be saved from tigers and other predators, if these officers execute their duties responsibly.”During the meeting, the minister also came down heavily on WCL officials for extensively planting thorny shrubs that are proving to be shelters for the predators. He directed the WCL, CSTPS and forest department to clean the thorny shrubs from 5km area around the city so as to destroy the shelters of the predators.He also underlined the need to break the corridors leading from jungle to urban areas.“I have also directed to provide a toll free number to the citizens to report any sighting of tigers or other predators, so that forest department could initiate immediate remedial measures,” the guardian minister told TOI.CSTPS officers were directed to complete the repairs and perimeter compound wall around its areas to prevent entry of tigers and other predators.Social media abuzz with tiger sighting videosReports of sighting of a tiger in Haveli Garden area, another on the fly-ash pipeline of the CSTPS and a bear with two cubs near Ambedkar Sabhagruha in Wadgaon ward of the city has stirred the civic administration.Extensive cleaning drive to remove the shrubs from both the localities and also from Rashtrawadi Nagar on the outskirts of CSTPS is being carried out by the municipal corporation.A video of tiger moving through Haveli Garden area in the night has gone viral on social media. Another video showing a tiger on purported fly-ash pipeline of the CSTPS is also doing rounds on the Internet.Corporator of Wadgaon ward Pradeep Deshmukh confirmed the reports of repeated sighting of bear close to Ambedkar Sabhagruha, but maintained that reports about tiger sighting in Haveli Garden area remain unverified.']
