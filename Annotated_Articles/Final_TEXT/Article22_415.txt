(Representational image) By India Today Web Desk: A 42-year-old woman was trampled to death by a wild elephant in the Badki Dundi village of Ramgarh district, Jharkhand on Tuesday. The incident took place when the woman had gone to a field to collect Mahua leaves along with two other women. Suddenly, an elephant reached there from the side of the forest. The women panicked and started running, but the elephant caught Pinky Devi (42) and grabbed her with its trunk and slammed her onto the ground. She died on the spot. The other women were able to escape safely. advertisement As soon as the news of the elephant attack spread in the village, hundreds of villagers gathered near the body of the woman. Angry villagers were not allowing the forest department team to take the body post-mortem. Villagers allege that this incident happened due to the negligence of the forest department. Tapeshwar Mehta, a villager, said that such incidents happen in the rural area every day. A forester of the Kujju Range, Sunil Kumar, who reached the spot, said that the department got the information that an elephant had killed a woman and they reached the spot. The process of compensation which is done by the Forest Department will be completed soon.
