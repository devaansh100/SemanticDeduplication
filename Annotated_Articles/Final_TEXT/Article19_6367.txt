In a similar incident, a leopard wandered into a residential colony at Seepz in the western suburb of Andheri. The big catâ€™s presence spooked the residents but they remained calm and alerted the forest department. The forest department officials then got into action and scanned the CCTV footage from the entire area along with monitoring their own camera traps to pinpoint the exact location of the leopard. The animal had been on the prowl in the area for over a week and hence, a lot of footage had to be viewed swiftly. The leopard had earlier tracked a dog and attacked another on the same night, hence it was decided to track him using the routes used for hunting down dogs. Later, a security guard spotted the leopard in the compound and alerted the authorities. The animal was caught using special traps so as to not hurt it. It was subsequently released inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park. "]
