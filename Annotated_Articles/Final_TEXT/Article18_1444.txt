['‘Aam-pathy’: UP police constable feeds monkey\nAs summer reaches its peak, everyone seems to be relishing mangoes and monkeys are no exception to this essential summer activity. On Sunday, the Uttar Pradesh police shared a heart-warming video that showed a police constable giving a mango to a monkey. In the 17-second clip, one can see a constable sitting in a police vehicle and cutting a mango as a monkey, with a baby on its back, watches him. The monkey extends its hands towards the constable for the fruit and the constable obliges instantly. Soon the monkey is seen feasting on the juicy fruit. While sharing the clip on their official Twitter handle, the Uttar Pradesh Police wrote, “UP 112, सबके ‘Mon-key’ समझे..Well Done Constable Mohit, PRV1388 Shahjahapur for making good deeds an ‘Aam Baat’ #PyarKaMeethaPhal #UPPCares”.

Many netizens praised the police constable for his kind gesture. It should be common enough sense to not feed wild animals especially those explicitly classified as vermins! They’re a threat to life and property and by feeding them you are encouraging their behavioural patterns when amidst humans. https://t.co/iUKMwwEuHs — Anshika Shukla (@anshikashukla_) June 13, 2022 Humanity comes from within.

Have love for all beings, this is humanity.” However, some people pointed out that humans should avoid feeding monkeys as it makes them dependent on humans. Echoing this sentiment, a Twitter user wrote, “It should be common enough sense to not feed wild animals, especially those explicitly classified as vermins! They’re a threat to life and property and by feeding them you are encouraging their behavioural patterns when amidst humans.”']
