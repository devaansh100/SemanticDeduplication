When on his visit to the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico he randomly decided to perform a simple magic trick in front of a monkey at the zoo, the monkey and his reaction to the trick were fortunately caught on camera. The monkey’s reaction has gone viral on the internet. In the viral footage, the TikTok user can be seen holding a leaf in his right in front of the monkey’s face. The monkey while initially disinterested, gets blown away when Ibarra ‘vanishes’ the leaf by running his hand over the leaf.
