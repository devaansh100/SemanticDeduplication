The carcass was first spotted by locals who informed forest authorities. Naveen Khandelwal , divisional forest officer of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve ( PTR ) and part of the team that rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation, told TOI, "Her canines, nails and all body parts were found intact except some bruises at a few spots. So, we are ruling out the "poaching" angle. On Sunday morning, the carcass will be sent to the Bareilly-based Indian Veterinary Research Institute for autopsy. The exact cause of death will be ascertained after the autopsy report comes in."The officer added that the stripe pattern of the feline would also be shared with the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India for an expert opinion. This would help in finding out where the tigress was born.Notably, this is the third tiger death in the year so far. Prior to this, the carcass of a 6-year-old male tiger was found from the same spot in January. Besides, a seven-eight months old tiger cub was found dead in the Haripur forest range of PTR on May 12.Pilibhit has lost 21 tigers between 2012-22. Out of these, eight were found dead in canals.']
