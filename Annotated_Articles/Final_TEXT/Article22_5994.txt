As the camera focuses on the leopard, a lifeless monkey is seen caught in his jaws. Gripping the tree with its paws, the leopard slowly climbs down while still having the prey in his mouth. The leopard halts near a branch to figure out the best way down the tree and manages to reach the ground before vanishing in the forest. Twitter users were amazed to see the raw hunting as one highlighted how rarely such fascinating acts are captured. A video evidence of predation of Hanuman Langur by a common leopard on a tree. Such instances are really rare to observe and record. https://t.co/sI1Sdcbxcb— Virendra Mathur | विरेन्द्र माथुर 🐒🐒 (@AmazingVirus) May 29, 2022 Of course, this wasn’t the first time a leopard was caught hunting down its prey.
