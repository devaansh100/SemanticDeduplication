["From Cutting Off Leopard’s Head & Paws To Killing Strays For Fun: Nine Cases Of Animal Cruelty\nHumans and animals share a special bond. Most of us have a soft corner for animals but of late there are innumerous instances that have come to the fore highlighting our lack of basic humanity. Stray dogs are being killed for fun, dogs are getting raped and animals are continued to be maltreated quite often. These incidents make our blood boil with anger and merit stricter punishment for these heartless and shameless culprits. Here's the lowdown on a few incidents that showcase the brutal nature of people who have brought a huge shame to humanity for their dastardly and cowardly acts. 1. Body Of A Leopard With Its Head & Paws Cut Off, Found In Maharashtra In a gut-wrenching story of a voiceless creature being tortured by humans, the carcass of a leopard was found on Wardha-Mandwa road in Maharashtra, with its head and paws cut off.  Cases of animal cruelty are on the rise and it’s hard to understand how people can be so heartless, so as to mercilessly murder an animal. The picture of the leopard, with its head and paws, are cut off was posted on Twitter by IFS Parveen Kaswan. He captioned the picture ‘This #Leopard was found on a road at Maharashtra. His Head & paws were cut off. Now his nails, teeth etc will be sold in the market. Wildlife crime is a demand-based business. Say no to all kinds of animal products. Like this thousands are killed annually for their body parts. 2. Leopard Electrocuted And Burnt In Telangana Five people have been arrested for allegedly killing a leopard by electrocution and later burning its carcass in Adilabad district in Telangana. After obtaining reliable information, the officials apprehended one person for possessing claws of the leopard.  Upon interrogation, he confessed to having laid the electrical wire with the help of six other people to poach wild animals in a sorghum field. The accused had laid the electrical wire at night and found one electrocuted leopard. For fear of getting caught, the accused burned the wild animal's carcass after removing the claws and a tooth. A case has now been registered and five of the accused have been arrested. A hunt has been launched to nab two others who are reportedly absconding.  3. Pvt security guards in Gurgaon attempt to bury street dog alive In a cruel act, a group of security guards of an upscale apartment complex in Gurgaon's Sector-49 were caught trying to bury a stray dog after being brutally assaulted with batons by them on December 7. The incident was reported after some local residents rescued the dog from the dug-up pit after it was found crying.  The dog, that sustained fractures on its legs and head, was taken to a nearby veterinary hospital in the city's DLF Phase 3 where it is currently battling for life. According to PTI, the street dog had strayed into Uniworld Garden-II, the apartment complex. The private security guards who were inside tried to keep it out from the premises but failed. The supervisor later apparently directed the guards to corner the dog at one place and brutally beat it with batons. 4. 70-year-old frail elephant in Sri Lanka whose photos sparked outrage passes away. Perahera festival in Sri Lanka's Kandy is celebrated with much fervour and rigour in the country. Everything appears hunky dory on the outside when we see animals all decked up with top-notch costumes. What we missed out was the fact that there was an emaciated elephant behind the designer costumes during the festival. In August, the Save Elephant Foundation has posted photos of the tusker showing her performing at the festival with her frail body covered by a colourful costume. The pictures immediately shook the world's conscience to the core. However, the elephant couldn't survive long and died a month later. 5. Chennai man drags dog on road, beats it up then throws it into pond, gets arrested. indiatimes Dogs are supposed to be man's best friend but there are few people who think otherwise. If they don't treat them well, they have no authority to treat them badly either. In one such sickening incident, a man was seen dragging a dog on a busy road, after brutally beating it. He then flung the dog into a pond filled with sewage. The accused identified as 'Olli' Kumar is said to be a local goon and is known to torture dogs in the locality. 6. Three men in Agra kidnap neighbour's pet dog, take turns to rape it. BCCL Some cases leave you gasping for breath and words in equal measure for their disgusting nature. It becomes extremely difficult to put such heinous acts into words. Heartless people are brutalising the mute animals in ways that are unimaginable. In a case of animal cruelty, three men in UP's Hathras area, kidnapped a pet dog and took turns to rape the pooch. The dog owner said the accused lured her with an egg and raped her. All three accused were said to be drunk when they raped the Pomeranian dog. 7. In Thailand, animals are being used as photo props and jabbed with metal spikes for tourism. YouTube/PETA Most of us gets fascinated when we see animals in zoos, circuses alike. What we don't realise is the fact that these animals are confined to the walls of these places depriving them of their natural habitat. Thailand is one such country where cases of animal abuse has been on the rise. According to a recent investigation carried out by PETA, elephants - including babies - are tethered by extremely short chains. A disturbing footage reveals handlers jabbing the animals with sharp metal spikes to force them into giving rides and performing tricks, leaving them with bleeding wounds. At Samutprakarn, PETA found elephants swaying back and forth, a symptom of psychological distress, because they are forcefully cut off from the rest of the herd. 8.
