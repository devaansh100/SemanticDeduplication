The attacks by the apex predators are one of the major risks that threaten human lives in coastal regions, especially in tourist areas. Over the years, many shark experts and photographers have captured stunning images of the creatures attacking their prey or baring their jaws above or underwater. One photographer who captivates netizens regularly with his shark photos is Euan Rannachan. Back in 2019, managed to capture a great white shark in the pose that was shown in the 1975 Steven Spielberg film \'Jaws\'. Rannachan was inside a cage and just a few feet away from the shark when he managed to take the perfect picture. In addition to photos by professionals, there are scores of amateur videos on social media that show how deadly and unpredictable shark attacks can be. This time, a conversationalist showed the world in a viral clip what\'s it like to be eaten by a shark. The only tragedy of the story is that his camera was the prey. Filmmaker and conservationist Zimy Da Kid was shooting a documentary in the Maldives when a shark circled around towards him and tried tasting his camera. During the underwater shoot, a tiger shark chomped on and swallowed Zimm\'s 360-degree camera. The device was not destroyed instantly. It actually went deep into the shark\'s mouth and throat to capture a stunning visual. Watch it here: As the predator chomped on the camera multiple times, it was able to capture its razor-sharp teeth, gills on the inner walls, and its closed throat. The footage was quite a revelation for social media users because it showed that the inner areas of the shark\'s mouth were very smooth and clean. The creature didn\'t really eat the camera like meat. After realising it was not suitable for consumption, it spat it out and swam away. The clip was shared on Instagram with the caption: "That moment this curious Tiger Shark decided to taste my @insta360 camera during our last @deepseaguardians expedition." The camera that survived the attack was a Insta360 ONE X2 pocket action camera which costs nearly Rs 30,000.']
