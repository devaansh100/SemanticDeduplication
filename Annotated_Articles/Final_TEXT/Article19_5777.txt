They were intercepted at the exit.The passengers have been identified as Mohammad Parvaez,36, from Ramanathapuram district and Mohammad Akbar,28, from Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu. They arrived here from Kuala Lumpur in a Batik Airways flight.Their two stroller bags were opened for further examination. Both the bags were found to contain one big yellow plastic toy concealed in chocolates, gift items and personal clothing. On opening the toys, some cloth bags tied with rope were found in which some reptiles were concealed.On questioning, they informed that the bags were given to them by someone outside Kuala Lumpur airport with instructions to hand them over to someone outside Chennai airport who would identify them. They were taken outside the airport but no one turned up to receive the bags even after waiting for a considerable time.Forest officers were called to identify the reptile species. The species have been identified as: a green tree python (Morelia viridis), a scrub python (morelia amethystina) (Both are native of Australia and not covered under CITES), two black tree monitor lizards ( Varanus beccarii), five emerald tree monitor lizards (Varanus prasimus), two blue spotted tree monitor lizards (Varanus macraei), a Reisinger tree monitor (Varanus reisingeri), four sailfin lizards ( Hydrosaurus specie). The lizards, which are natives of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, fall under CITES (Appendix II ).A team of veterinary doctors from Arignar Anna Zoological Park inspected the animals and declared them to be in healthy condition.Animal quarantine officials recommended to deport the seized snakes and lizards to their country of origin as the passenger did not have any NOC/ DGFT licence for import into India. Both the passengers were detained.']
