According to sources, huge amount of flowers of Nahar trees are also supplied to traders outside the state from Padumoni area under Dulung Reserve Forest and from Banderdewa region under Harmutty Forest Range. Trafficking of Brwon Fish Owl, exotic Branded Krait snake and timber of endemic Siya Nahar from Kakoi Reserve Forest has also been going on for a long time in Lakhimpur district.']
