The zoological park announced the birth of the two lion cubs on Tuesday, stating in a release that the lioness had a “stress-free delivery despite the constant inflow of visitors” and the two cubs had “livened up the lion’s cage”. According to the authorities, the gender of the cubs is yet to be determined by experts but both of them and the mother lioness are healthy. The two cubs were born after midnight on Monday.
