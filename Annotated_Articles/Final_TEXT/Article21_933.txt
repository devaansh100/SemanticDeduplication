The arrests were made within 24 hours after forest officials found the leopard carcass.The incident took place in the forested area of Mathihalli village intaluk forest range in Sirsi. On December 16, a group of forest officials were on beat patrolling duty inside the forests when they sensed a decomposed smell emanating from a nearby waterspot.
