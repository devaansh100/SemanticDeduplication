Details Khan jumped metal grille, sat in front of the lion The incident took place at around 12:30 PM, when Khan, a native of Bihar\'s Champaran district, jumped over the metal grille, and went on to sit right in front of the feline, even though the guards tried to stop him.

Then we tranquilized the lion and rescued him," Riyaz Ahmed Khan, PRO at National Zoological Park, Delhi, told ANI. Quote Animal Rights activist questioned state of security at the zoo Meanwhile, Animal Rights activist Gauri Maulekhi questioned the state of security at the Delhi Zoo. "Even a few months back the lions\' enclosure had been breached as there were no proper locks," she said. "Even if it is deliberate, surely the fencing is not high enough, so people are able to enter? There should be absolutely no scope of such incidents," she summed. Information In 2014, man was killed by tiger in Delhi zoo Notably, this is not the first such instance. Earlier in September 2014, a 22-year-old man was brutally mauled to death by a white tiger in the Delhi zoo, after he accidentally slipped and fell inside the beast\'s enclosure.']
