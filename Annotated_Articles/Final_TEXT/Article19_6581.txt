By India Today Web Desk: A video of a fight between a tiger and a lion has surfaced on social media and is swiftly going viral. The 24-second clip was shared on Twitter by Indian Forest Service officer Susanta Nanda on Sunday. In a grassland, a tiger was seen sitting at rest while lions and other animals roamed around the enclosure. One of the lions, however, appeared to be interested in engaging in a battle with the tiger in a show of strength. advertisement The lion walked towards the tiger and struck it with its paw after biting on its neck. Immediately, the tiger retaliated and struck the lion on its face with its paw, as the latter landed several metres ahead. It walked away from the scenario after its defeat. "When it comes to paw and claw striking, a tiger acts like a boxer. This lion realised it in a hard way. Swipe of a tiger paw is powerful enough to smash a cow\'s skull. Watch the poor lion in slow motion," Susanta Nanda said in his caption. Watch the video here: When it comes to paw & claw striking, a tiger acts like a boxer. This lion realised it in a hard way.

Netizens shared their opinions about the clash between the tiger and the lion in the comments section. Some responses were quite funny as well. "Tiger is the heavier and the strongest. What makes lion the king is his ferociousness. He fights till his last breath with the same ferociousness. Tiger uses both claws to fight, Lions only one. Lion never concedes defeat, will fight till death," a user said. Another said, "Wow", after watching the video. I recall a story of a zoo tiger and lion in adjacent cages and the separating gate was open.

Also better fighters as they evolved as solitary hunters. girishkrish (@girishkrish6) December 29, 2019 And the lioness fell for him Nitish k.
