While the officials had set up a cage at the site of the tigressâ€™s latest kill near Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, it was another male tiger that ended up getting trapped. The male tiger and the tigress were seen together in the vicinity of the cage before the male tiger got trapped. The male tiger who got trapped has been now shifted to Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary in Bahraich for a medical examination. The animal is likely to be then shifted to Lucknow zoo.']
