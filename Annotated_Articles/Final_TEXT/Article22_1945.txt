Later, he carries the basket containing the snake and moves it around, as the crowd gets into a frenzy.“On Wednesday evening a local sent us a video clip of a person dancing with a snake at a wedding procession. We went to the spot and caught some of them red-handed. But members of the wedding party managed to escape,” said Srikant Naik , divisional forest officer of Karanjia. The forest officials detained five persons, including four band party members.The snake has been rescued. The Indian Cobra is listed under Schedule-II of the Wildlife Protection Act.
