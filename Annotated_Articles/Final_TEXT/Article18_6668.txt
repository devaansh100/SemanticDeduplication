['MP Tiger Task Force Arrest Two Hunters For Killing Leopard For Skin And Body Parts\nBHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh tiger strike force arrested two poachers in the Vidisha area of Madhya Pradesh when they were attempting to sell leopard skin and claws. According to officials, the duo peeled off a leopardâ€™s hide after it was trapped. They stabbed it and hid its hide in the forest. Sniffer dogs were deployed by forest officials to locate it. They were seized with a leopard hide, three claws, wild boar and porcupine remain, two leg-traps, and weapons. They were apprehended in Sironj, roughly 120 kilometres from Bhopal, by the Bhopal and Hoshangabad units of the Tiger Strike Force. Bagrunath of Sironj and Mohar Singh of Guna have been identified as the accused. They were charged under several provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused are being grilled to determine whether or not they are part of a larger network. Officials suspect the pair slaughtered several wild animals in Vidisha and other locations. In recent years, Madhya Pradesh has lost hundreds of leopards to poachers and road accidents, despite a strong emphasis on tiger conservation. Officers believe leopard hunting has become a problem in several places for religious reasons. Follow The420.in on Telegram | Facebook | Twitter | LinkedIn | Instagram | YouTube']
