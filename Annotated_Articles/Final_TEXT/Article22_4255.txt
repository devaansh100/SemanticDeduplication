Steve Irwin, who passed away in 2006 after a stingray accident, was famous all over the world for the way he handled wild animals, especially crocodiles. For this reason, he earned the moniker 'The Crocodile Hunter'. Ever since his death, his family has paid tribute to his legacy in various ways. Robert Clarence Irwin has followed in his father’s footsteps to become a skilled crocodile handler. He has paid tribute to his father through various TV appearances and conservation work. In 2019, Robert recreated the iconic moment of his dad feeding a crocodile in 2004. Interestingly, the picture was taken at the exact same location and from the same angle. Even the crocodile was the same. But just like Steve Irwin, even Robert experiences scary moments while handling wild animals. One such moment was released on social media by the Irwins recently, The 18-year-old was forced to flee an enclosure after a huge crocodile lunged at him at Australia Zoo. The footage shows Robert asking his fellow zookeepers to 'bail' after the croc named Casper tried attacking him. The footage is part of the final episode of Crikey! It's The Irwins. Watch it here: “By getting in their enclosures with them, and letting them put on those huge strikes from the water’s edge, they get to use all of their predatory instincts and they just love it! Plus we can educate everyone about their conservation,” the post reads. The incident happened when Robert was attempting to feed Casper and check whether he was comfortable in his new enclosure. The 350kg reptile completely ignored the food offered by Robert and lunged towards him with snapping jaws. As a result, he was forced to exit the enclosure, shouting 'bail, bail, bail'. Footage captured from the top shows Robert narrowly escaping the crocodile's jaws. Casper is a leucistic saltwater crocodile, which means he is lighter in colour and is difficult to spot due to a dramatic reduction in dark skin pigment."]
