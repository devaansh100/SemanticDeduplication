The held mafia have been identified as Suresh Karna and Kalia Karna of Meghanad village under Ulunda police limits of the same district.

After the mafia duo from Rampur area reached the venue of the deal, Samantray arrested them to seize the tusks. “The seized 65 cm long tusks weigh around 3 kg and costs over lakhs,” said forest department source.
