['20 ‘langurs’ rescued in raid at Unnao village; 2 arrested\nKanpur: In a joint raid conducted by the Special Task Force ( STF ) and forest department, 20 ‘langurs’ were rescued from Unnao ’s Patan village and two persons were arrested on Sunday. The ‘langurs’ were supposed to be smuggled to a poacher in Badaun.A case has been registered under the Wildlife Act, 1972, at the Bihar police station in this regard. The accused have confessed that they bring langurs from Unnao and sell them for Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000. The smugglers have also revealed the names of their accomplices.Bihar police station in-charge Sudhir Kumar told TOI that acting on a specific tip-off, a raid was conducted by the sleuths of STF and the forest department at a dilapidated structure in Patan village from where two persons were arrested and 20 ‘langurs’ locked in steel cage were rescued.The accused Saddam Beg and Nadeem Khan are residents of Fatehpur district. Police also seized a four-wheeler from their possession. The ‘langurs’ and the vehicle have been handed over to the forest department for further action.An official, who interrogated the accused said, “They have admitted that they supply ‘langurs’ to a Badaun-based wildlife poacher Arjun . They have not revealed much about their other aides. Perhaps, in lieu of each ‘langur’, they used to get Rs 8000-Rs 10,000.”However, the investigators are yet to ascertain why the langurs were being smuggled. “As of now, the smugglers revealed that they used to sell the ‘langurs’ to earn their livelihood,” said an STF official privy to the investigation.This is the third major smuggling incident of ‘langurs’ in the last five years, said forest officials. Earlier, in 2021, about 14 ‘langurs’ were recovered from Badaun with the arrest of three persons. Similarly, in 2018, 14 ‘langurs’ were rescued from smugglers in Shahjahanpur.According to police, the information about the gang is being extracted from the smugglers, particularly about Arjun to whom they used to sell ‘langurs’.“We will also question Ram Asrey Verma from whose dilapidated house, the 20 ‘langurs’ were recovered. The smugglers said they have been using the place to hide ‘langurs’ for the past many years,” police further said.']
