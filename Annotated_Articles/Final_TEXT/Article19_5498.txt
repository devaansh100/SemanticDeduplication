The bizarre incident has left bystanders bewildered and wildlife activists enraged. Police officials, however, were not surprised by the incident. An official said, "Such endangered species are kept as pets by high profile individuals and the persons who carry them in their luggage are merely couriers who do this for a sum of money. Usually, such reptiles and animals are smuggled in from Bangkok, but now KL has also become an origin point.‚Äù']
