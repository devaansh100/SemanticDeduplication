The bench then posted the plea to January 21 for the forest department to file an affidavit on the condition of translocated animals and guidelines for catching them.Earlier, the department opposed the plea submitting that 497 spotted deer had died on the IIT-Madras campus and CLRI premises in the past five years. Autopsy had revealed that most of the deer had four to six kilograms of plastic waste in their stomachs, it said.According to the department, Raj Bhavan, IIT -Madras and CLRI premises are not the natural habitat of spotted deer. The areas do not offer food, water and cover offered by natural habitat. Due to fragmentation of the area because of construction of buildings, fences and compound walls all around these institutions, deer which were once moving all around in the open areas got trapped in such campuses and were exposed to various threats, it said.']
