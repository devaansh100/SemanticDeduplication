He sat on a tree on the building premises for nearly two hours before trying to sneak into the the actor’s flat under the cover of darkness, but was caught by the security guards, who handed him over to the police.Kumar was not at home, said the police. The youth, Ankit Goswami, was arrested and booked for trespassing under the Indian Penal Code. The actor has police personnel outside his residence, said sources.“Ankit said he was a die-hard Akshay fan and came to Mumbai only to meet him,” said zonal DCP Paramjit Singh Dahiya. “Ankit said a tempo parked outside the building helped him scale the compound wall. He then hid in a tree for nearly two hours before trying to enter the building at night to reach the actor’s flat.”Ankit, who is currently in judicial custody, promised the police that he would return home to Haryana if they arranged a meeting with the actor. “Ankit said he used the internet to get Akshay Kumar’s address. Despite his father’s objections, he left home on Sunday with Rs 5,000 and caught a train to Mumbai. He reached Bandra Terminus on Monday,” said Juhu senior inspector Pandrinath Wavhal. “We have informed his father Bhijendra, a milkman, about the arrest. He is on the way to Mumbai to bail out his son.”On Tuesday, Ankit reached the actor’s building but was stopped by the security guards at the gates. Upset he decided not to return home till he met his ‘God’. He jumped atop a parked tempo and scaled the compound wall. He then hid on a tree, said the police. Around 1.30am, on Wednesday, he climbed down the tree and was trying to get into the building, when the guards spotted him and nabbed him.Despite having no personal contact with celebrities, fans build a connect with them through media exposure, say psychiatrists. “Fans start idolizing an actor after being strongly attracted to the character he plays on screen... sometimes causing a strong urge to meet him in person,” said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. “Sometimes, fans may be deluded to believe that they have a right over them... those with immature personalities and poor self-worth may be more prone. A power to possess may be the driving force behind such obsessive behaviour. Such a rush may also lead to hurting their idol when their desires are not fulfilled.”']
