The recent nabbing of poachers from Lakhimpur Kheri and Pithoragarh are also alarming.”On March 3, five poachers were seized with 20 tiger bones in Lakhimpur Kheri. On February 14th in Takiyapurva village near Dudhwa Tiger Reserve’s Bailrayan Forest Range, two persons were caught with the hide of an adult tiger, which officials said appeared to have been killed barely a few days ago.At more than 240, CTR has the world's largest bengal tiger population. “The south boundary of Corbett is particularly concerning. There is no buffer zone after Kalagarh core zone from Jhirna (a 15-km stretch). The villages of Uttar Pradesh start right at the boundary and poachers find the patch easy to breach,” said a senior IFS officer on the condition of anonymity.As the forest fire season (Feb 15-June 15 in Uttarakhand) has already started, wild animals are more susceptible to poaching as they try to escape blazes.Meanwhile, senior officers of the forest department and the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) are currently at CTR, although the reason for their visit is unknown."]
