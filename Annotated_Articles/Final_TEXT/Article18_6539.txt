["Young Tusker Found Dead In Farmland In Odisha's Kalahandi\nThe carcass of an elephant was found lying on a farmland in Bagpur village under Kalahandiâ€™s Narla forest range on Saturday. The dead elephant was said to be in its twenties and its tusk were intact. Several injury marks were found on the body of the jumbo. Though the cause of its death is still unclear, looking at the wounds on its body, the forest department suspected that the elephant might have been attacked by other elephants. A female elephant was electrocuted in the same area just two days back by coming in contact with live wire put up by the farmers to prevent animals from destroying crops. Similarly, the Odisha Wildlife Special Task Force (STF) had exhumed the skeletal remains of an elephant in the Balikiari reserve forest under Narasinghpur (West) Forest Range in Cuttack last Tuesday. From the state of decomposition, it was believed that the elephant could have died 6-8 months ago. Last year, at least eight pachyderms had succumbed to septicaemia in a span of just 21 days in the Karlapat reserve forest in the district."]
