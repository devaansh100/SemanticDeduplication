On September 23, a tigress was found dead in the Dhela range of the Corbett Tiger Reserve. The carcass of the tigress bore multiple injury marks. The autopsy report indicates the tigress, who was aged around seven years, died of injuries following a fight with another big cat. This was the fifth tiger death reported from Corbett this year. Earlier in July this year, residents of Mataina village in Pilibhit district of Uttar Pradesh killed an adult tigress after she reportedly injured nine people over the course of a few days. The animal was beaten to death, not far from where forest rangers were stationed in the area. The villagers were angered after the big cat pounced upon a 19-year-old youth even as some other people were undergoing treatment for injuries suffered in tigress attacks. Later, the villagers were reported to have surrounded the tigress and mercilessly assaulted her with lathis and spears before forest officials could arrive at the spot.']
