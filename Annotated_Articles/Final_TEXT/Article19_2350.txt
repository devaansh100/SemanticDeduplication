The bird had hit a restaurant, after which it was treated by the experts and later set free in in a local forest.Pardeep Thakur, conservator wild life talking to TOI told that the bird hit a local restaurant of Dharamkot area. People contacted concerned officials who took it for treatment.“Our experts treated the bird. We decided not to keep the creature in captivity at zoo, so our staff took it to the high mountainous area to let him free,” he added.Thakur said the bird is known as Catreus Wallichi ( Cheer Pheasant ). It lives in Himalayan region. Due to heavy snow this year on mountains, it might have migrated to low areas.“Cheer Pheasant is a large bird, with long and broad, barred tail, red skin, a prominent crest and legs proportionally short,” he added.Usually it is during winter season only that birds from higher attitude areas migrate to low hills. They often fall prey to poachers or hit massive constructions particularly at hilly destinations. However, heavy snowfall on mountains this year is making these creatures move from their original habitat.']
