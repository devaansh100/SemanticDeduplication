The clip featured the officers applying the concept of the Archimedes‚Äô Principle and filling the hole with water to allow the young jumbo to get out. The video was shared by District Forest Officer (DFO) Sandeep Berwal, on Monday, 21 February. The short video shows the elephant struggling to get out of the ditch it had fallen into. The young jumbo tries to push itself out of the furrow using its trunk, but is unable to do so. According to Berwal, the forest officers rushed to the spot after midnight. Using Archimedes‚Äô Principle, the officers filled the ditch with water to create some buoyancy. They then used ropes to help the elephant scramble out of the furrow.

It has gained over one lakh views till date. The Archimedes‚Äô Principle states that ‚Äúa body at rest in a fluid is acted upon by a force pushing upward called the buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces,‚Äù according to Britannica Encyclopedia. It is named after the Greek mathematician and physicist Archimedes, who formulated the theory. Berwal stated that the officers got the young jumbo out of the ditch by 4 am. The elephant returned to the forest after it was pulled out by the forest officers. The video of the elephant being recused won hearts online, with many users praising the forest officials for their quick thinking. Simple presence of mind and genuine determination to rescue. Hatsoff ‚Äî #Random_Thought (@Dhakkann) February 21, 2022 Several people also pointed out that such pits could be dangerous for animals and need to be covered up for their safety. Great job. Such deep pits are dangerous for animals at night. Should be covered ‚Äî Vivek (@Vivek64980627) February 21, 2022 Some users also recalled earlier instances when they had seen the Archimedes‚Äô Principle being applied to rescue animals from furrows. 3 years ago, a big male buffalo fell into well in my village. We did the same thing, put more water in we so that water level raises up and he comes out easily. ‚Äî ‡§™‡§Ç: ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Æ‡§∏‡•á‡§® (@ambikeshtiwari9) February 21, 2022 Many people congratulated the forest officers for pulling off the rescue attempt successfully and efficiently.
