A new mammal menace has forced homeowners in an English county to barricade their ponds.

Police in Corsham, Wiltshire sounded a \'lock up your fish\' alert after a string of fish theft reports were registered. The police have advised locals to install either a welded mesh or erect a wired fence to keep their fish safe, according to a Metro.co.uk report. "We appreciate this is not a police matter but the fish are worth a lot of money. A wire fence similar to that used for cattle which consists of a single wire around the pond supported about 4ft from the ground," the police said in a statement. Katie Spragg, a local, said she lost up to 30 white goldfish and koi carp to hungry otters. "I initially thought the heron was somehow getting them. Then one autumn evening I heard splashing in the pond. When I looked over the raised pond wall I saw an otter sauntering along the edge of the water. It disappeared into undergrowth and I just stood there in shock," said Katie. Some home surveillance cameras have captured the carnivorous mammals scurrying away with their prey in their mouth. Otters are protected species in the UK. But they are notorious for raiding homes between dusk and down.']
