On Wednesday night, the leopard was trapped. A Forest Department team, including veterinarian S Sadasivam found it to be in good health. Officials said the leopard, aged around four years, was to be released in Thengumarahada area. Meanwhile, tense moments prevailed when the leopard escaped while shifting it from one cage to another.
