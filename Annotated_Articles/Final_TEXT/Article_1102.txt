Finally, missing tiger claws recovered
Keri/Valpoi: Little over two weeks after the carcass of a tiger was found inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary at Golauli village in Sattari’s Dongurli-Thane panchayat, the forest department on Tuesday recovered all 14 of the animal’s missing nails from the village’s Kelbai temple.The investigation team of the wildlife division of the forest department was led by investigation officer Nandkumar Parab.“We got information from reliable sources that the tiger claws were in Golauli and accordingly we came up with a strategy. This morning, the Sateri-Kelbai temple priest found the claws wrapped in a plastic bag in the sanctum sanctorum. We took possession of them after conducting the panchanama. We are investigating the matter in depth,” Parab told TOI.On the request of the investigating team, Valpoi PI Shivram Vaingankar pressed a sniffer dog into service, which led the team to a freshly dug pit in a cashew plantation in the village. Officials are investigating whether the nails had been buried there before being shifted to the temple.Parab said that an unidentified person placed the nails in the temple during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday.“I was in Golauli along with my team for the past two to three days. As part of the investigation we had summoned a few suspects from the village,” Parab said.Tiger nails are highly priced in national and international markets, and given that they were found missing from the carcasses of the tiger found on January 5, it had raised speculation about possible poaching happening in the area and raised questions about the safety of the big cats.
