” O
environmentalist O
and O
state O
coordinator O
of O

Arvind O
Mishra O
said O
. O

One O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
why O
poaching O
continued O
to O
take O
place O
was O
that O
forest O
department O
staff O
were O
not O
equipped O
with O
arms O
and O
hence O
, O
on O
some O
occasions O
, O
they O
refused O
to O
act O
against O
poachers O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
being O
attacked O
, O
Mishra O
said O
. O

According O
to O
him O
, O
two-thirds O
of O
north O
Bihar O
was O
wetlands O
that O
attracted O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
migratory O
birds O
every O
year O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
involve O
locals O
and O
sensitise O
them O
to O
protect O
the O
birds O
, O
” O
Mishra O
said O
. O

The O
number O
of O
migratory O
birds O
visiting O
Bihar O
could O
be O
around O
25 O
- O
30 O
lakh O
, O
he O
added O
. O

The O
state O
government O
had O
, O
of O
late O
, O
launched O
initiatives O
to O
create O
awareness O
among O
locals O
about O
the O
birds O
and O
held O
as O
many O
as O
two O
festivals O
in O
the O
past O
two O
months O
. O

A O
three-day O
festival O
was O
recently O
organised O

in O
Jamui O

, O
some O
200 O
kilometres O

, O
January O

to O
create O

about O

. O

“ O
This O

a O
big O

Experts O
say O
many O
of O
the O
migratory O
birds O
fly O
13 O
days O
to O
arrive O
at O
such O
sanctuaries O
during O

announced O
his O

the O

In O

said O
the O
selection O
of O
Bhagalpur O
for O
the O
bird O
festival O
held O
significance O
given O

that O
