Hindu O
mythological O
text O
, O
they O

long O
as O
they O

the O

survive O

good O

for O
the O
Wildlife O
Conservation O

Unit O
( O

at O

Yet O
, O
despite O
their O
ability O
to O
withstand O
tough O
conditions O
, O
their O
rehabilitation O
after O
the O
seizure O
is O
a O
big O
concern O
among O
wildlife O
activists O
and O
experts O
. O

“ O
When O
an O
animal O
is O
put O
in O
gunny O
bags O
for O
days O
, O
it O
would O
be O
under O
high O
stress O
, O
” O
said O
Mr O
Girisha O
. O

“ O
They O
have O
to O
be O
relaxed O
and O
need O
immediate O
medical O
attention O
for O
conditioning O
them O
before O
they O
are O
sent O
to O
the O
natural O
environment O
. O

The O
doctor O
there O
has O
to O
make O
an O
assessment O
, O
whether O
the O
reptile O
is O
healthy O
enough O
to O
be O
released O
into O
the O
wild O
. O
” O

“ O
The O
welfare O
issues O
in O
this O
trade O
are O
really O
abysmal O
, O
” O
added O
Mr O
Mookerjee O
. O

“ O
They O
are O
taped O
up O
, O
not O
fed O
for O
many O
many O
days O
and O
are O
exported O
miles O
away O
from O
the O
natural O
environment O
they O
are O
endemic O
to O
. O

Obviously O
, O
trade O
mortality O
is O
very O
very O
high O
. O
” O

“ O
In O
fact O
, O
in O
many O
of O
the O
places O
where O
they O
are O
rescued O
, O
people O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
they O
are O
water O
turtles O
or O
dry O
land O
turtles O
and O
they O
are O
released O
in O
the O
water O
body O
. O

The O
reptile O
drowns O
and O
dies O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

Another O
concern O
about O
releasing O
an O
alien O
turtle O
into O
freshwater O
bodies O
is O
that O
they O
could O
overpower O
the O
native O
population O
and O
become O
dominant O
there O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
American O
red-eared O
slider O
turtle O
. O

Though O
native O
to O
the O
central O
and O
eastern O
United O
States O
, O
the O
species O
was O
accidentally O
released O
to O
the O
Sukhna O
Lake O
in O
the O
north O
Indian O
state O
of O
Punjab O

is O
now O
dominating O

While O
the O

trade O
has O
been O
a O
menace O
in O

long O
time O
, O
it O
did O
not O

receive O
this O

The O
concern O
was O

raised O
seriously O
in O

of O
Parties O
of O

held O
in O
2016 O

The O
international O
body O
undertook O
an O
investigation O
according O
to O
which O
between O
2000 O
to O
2015 O
, O
more O
than O
300,000 O
turtles O
and O
tortoise O
were O
illegally O
traded O
across O
the O
world O
. O

Among O
those O
, O
Indian O
Star O
Tortoise O
accounted O
for O
roughly O
35,000 O
. O

“ O
More O
than O
10 O
per O

. O

This O
is O
when O
we O
did O
not O
know O
the O
actual O
scale O
of O
the O
illegal O
trade O
in O
freshwater O

trade O
. O

The O
real O
numbers O
would O
be O
much O
higher O

” O
said O
Mr O

In O
fact O
, O
a O
separate O
study O
published O
in O

showed O
that O
in O

alone O
, O
at O

55,000 O

were O
poached O
in O

. O

“ O
Star O

, O

is O
largely O
traded O
for O

purposes O

” O
explained O
Mr O

, O
one O
of O
the O
co-authors O
of O
the O

“ O

the O
