The O

nearly O
a O

Environmentalist O
Sumit O

said O
that O
since O
the O
last O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
he O
along O
with O
many O
local O
community O

, O
has O
been O
gathering O
information O
on O
any O
poaching O
related O
cases O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
Jaisalmer O

. O

“ O
This O
work O
was O
part O
of O
a O
long O
term O
wildlife O
monitoring O
and O
conservation O
project O
of O
the O
great O
Indian O
bustard O
. O

In O
the O
last O
two O
years O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
locate O
many O
spots O
where O
the O
spiny-tailed O
lizards O
were O
regularly O
hunted O
. O

While O
narrowing O
down O
the O
information O
and O
finding O
the O
culprit O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
pass O
information O
to O
the O
forest O

successfully O
four O
cases O
were O
booked O
in O
the O
last O
two O

This O
current O
chinkara O
poaching O
case O
is O
interestingly O
related O
with O
the O

gang O
of O
culprits O

” O
Dookia O
told O
Mongabay-India O

He O
said O
that O
they O
believe O
that O
this O

is O
a O
big O
breakthrough O
in O
cracking O
a O
national O
level O
network O
of O
supplying O
spiny-tailed O
lizards O
to O
southern O
India O
, O
where O
the O
desert-dwelling O
reptiles O
have O
been O
confiscated O
multiple O
times O
. O

“ O
A O
thorough O
investigation O
on O
these O
lines O
is O
required O
and O
hopefully O
the O
forest O

will O
be O
able O
to O
crack O
the O
