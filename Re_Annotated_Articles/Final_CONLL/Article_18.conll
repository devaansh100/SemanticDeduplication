the O

there O
is O
no O
upper O
price O
cap O
for O
an O
animal O
that O
is O
foreign O
like O
a O

a O

, O
but O
among O
the O
most O
sought-after O
exotic O

, O
the O
hyacinth O
macaw O
commands O
the O
highest O
price O
in O
India O
. O

“ O
A O
pair O
could O
cost O
up O
to O
Rs O
15 O
lakh O
, O
” O
he O
says.In O
FY2021 O
, O
even O
as O
scheduled O
airlines O
were O
not O
flying O
into O
India O
because O
of O
Covid O
, O
authorities O
detected O
at O
least O
five O
import O
violations O
in O
air O
cargo O
. O

The O
consignments O
in O
question O
were O
unrelated O
to O
each O
other O
and O
arrived O
on O
various O
dates O
from O
three O
nations O
— O
China O
, O
UAE O
and O
Thailand O
. O

The O
seized O
items O
included O
three O
sets O
of O
canine O
teeth O
of O
the O
panthera O
species O
from O
the O
Chennai O
airport O
and O
eight O
photo O
frames O
and O
tissue O
boxes O
made O
of O
reticulated O
python O
skins O
from O
the O
Delhi O
airport O
; O
both O
violated O
India O
’ O

export-import O
laws O
and O
international O
rules O
being O
framed O
by O
CITES O
( O

. O
Though O
there O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
few O
arrests O
and O
convictions O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
illicit O
wildlife O
trade O
— O
for O
example O
, O
304 O
poachers O
were O
arrested O
in O
India O
in O
FY2021 O
in O
connection O
with O
109 O
incidents O
— O
too O
many O
laws O
with O
several O
opaque O
provisions O
help O
end O
customers O
get O
away O
with O
their O
expensive O
buys O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
Wildlife O
( O
Protection O
) O
Act O
, O
1972 O
, O
which O
has O
a O
provision O
of O
jail O
term O
up O
to O
seven O
years O
, O
does O
not O
cover O
exotic O
wildlife O
. O

This O
means O
, O
if O
an O
enforcement O
agency O
catches O
someone O
rearing O
a O
pair O
of O
hyacinth O
macaws O
or O
dozens O
of O
Mexican O
spiders O
in O
their O
Mehrauli O
farmhouse O
, O
not O
much O
can O
be O
done O
under O
India O
’ O
s O
existing O
laws O
. O

It O
is O
a O
unique O
situation O
where O
the O
import O
of O
such O
an O
exotic O
item O
is O
banned O
under O
the O
Customs O
A O
c O
t O
1962 O
, O
read O
with O
the O
Foreign O
Trade O
( O
Development O
and O
Regulation O
) O
Act O
, O
1992 O
, O
but O
no O
illegality O
can O
be O
established O
if O
someone O
is O
keeping O
such O
a O
bird O
or O
an O
animal O
at O
home O
. O

This O
explains O
why O
a O
growing O
number O
of O
people O
are O
eager O
to O
buy O
and O
keep O
an O
exotic O
macaw O
or O
marmoset O
in O
their O
garden O
. O

“ O
The O
usual O
excuse O
is O
, O
‘ O
we O
have O
not O
imported O
those O
; O
they O
have O
been O
with O
us O
for O
many O
years O
; O
we O
are O
breeding O
those O
here O
’ O
, O
” O
says O
TRAFFIC O
’ O
s O
Badola O
. O

And O
that O
normally O
puts O
an O
end O
to O
an O
investigation O
, O
if O
any.After O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
Covid O
pandemic O
in O
2019 O
, O
the O
aspect O
of O
zoonotic O
diseases O
has O
been O
taken O
seriously O
by O
enforcement O
agencies O
handling O
global O
wildlife O
items O
. O

When O
asked O
what O
would O
be O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
107 O
tarantulas O
, O
the O
then O
commissioner O
of O
customs O
at O
Chennai O
International O

, O
Rajan O
Chaudhary O
, O
says O
: O
“ O
The O
parcel O
was O

The O

will O
be O

that O
was O
given O
as O
the O

of O

) O
are O
investigating O
the O
matter O
further O
. O
” O
Though O
there O
is O
no O
data O
available O
on O
the O
level O
of O
corruption O
in O
such O
crimes O
, O
traffickers O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
greasing O
the O
palm O
of O

personnel O
across O
the O
globe O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
how O
could O
a O
live O
leopard O
cub O
, O
which O
was O
eventually O
caught O
at O
the O
exit O
of O
Chennai O

two O

, O
go O
undetected O
during O
the O

? O

And O
how O
did O
the O
two O
baby O
chimpanzees O
travel O
unnoticed O
from O
Istanbul O
? O

The O
question O
of O
their O
non-detection O
is O
relevant O
because O
high-value O
wildlife O
products O
, O
either O
live O
or O
dead O
, O
are O
often O
carried O
through O
