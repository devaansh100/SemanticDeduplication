The O

clearly O
states O
that O
the O

an O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
birds O
die O
en-route O
due O
to O
stressful O
conditions O
. O

Parakeets O
are O
social O
birds O
so O
keeping O
them O
in O
caged O

isolated O
conditions O
affects O
their O
physical O
and O

well-being O

Moreover O
, O
their O
life O

reduced O

the O

. O

However O
, O
it O
remains O
a O
highly O
coveted O
pet O
and O
a O
spiritual O
symbol O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
its O
striking O
shell O
that O

a O
star-like O

yellow O

Another O
‘ O
exotic O

’ O
that O
has O
gained O
popularity O
across O
the O

is O
the O
Red-eared O
slider O
turtle O

a O
species O

. O

Now O
most O
people O
are O
unaware O
that O
Red-eared O
sliders O
are O
an O
invasive O
species O
, O
so O
if O
they O
are O
released O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
they O
have O
the O
tendency O
to O
compete O
with O
native O
species O
for O
food O
, O
habitat O

other O
resources O
. O

It O
is O
illegal O

The O

a O

on O
the O

The O

The O
first O
step O
to O
