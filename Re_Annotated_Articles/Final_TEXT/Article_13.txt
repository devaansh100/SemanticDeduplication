*Seven Juvenile Indian Marsh Crocodiles rescued from illegal trade*
A raid was conducted last week, by Thane anti extortion cell in which seven Indian juvenile marsh crocodiles were seized from illegal wildlife trade. 
The joint-operation was carried out in coordination with police, Thane forest department and Rohit Mohite, Honorary Wildlife Warden (WWA's secretary) 
Further investigation is going on now to find out if any more crocodile were sold to anyone so that they could be recovered. 
These juvenile crocodiles are currently under our care until a decision from court is made.
We had previously rescued 8 crocodiles from Nashik and 2 in Thane from the clutches of illegal wildlife trade. 
We would like to request everyone to - #DontBuyTrouble as all Indian wildlife is protected under Wildlife Protection Act 1972. . 
We would like to thank the state police and forest department for always providing the necessary support to stop illegal wildlife trade.
