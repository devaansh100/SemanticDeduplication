Bah ranger R K Singh Rathod told India Today that the hundreds of baby turtles are being released every year in the Chambal river by teams of Turtle Survival Alliance, which collect the turtle eggs from the sandy banks of the river and then hatch them in an artificial hatchery. These turtles are raised in the hatchery till they are old enough to survive on their own, after which they are released. TSA Project Officer Pawan Pareek said that the TSA holds meetings with the local villagers from time to time and educates them about the importance of turtles in a river ecosystem and it is unfortunate that some poachers are damaging this delicate ecosystem by killing these turtles for their meat.
