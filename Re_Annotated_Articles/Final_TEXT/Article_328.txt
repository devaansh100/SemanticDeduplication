During the interrogation, they admitted their crime and also told names of three other gang members. Searches are on to nab them,” said a forest officer. “The duo were produced at a court in Alipurduar on Monday and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days,” he added. “We are taking the help of police to trace the other three who are involved in the crime. A probe is on,” said Budhraj Sewa, the field director of the BTR.
