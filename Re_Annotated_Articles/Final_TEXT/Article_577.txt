Dailyhunt
A man was arrested from Malda in north Bengal while trying to traffic around 1000 birds, mostly Alexandrine parakeets and hill myna, from Nepal on Wednesday night. The birds were crammed in cages with their beaks tied with rubber bands to prevent them from chirping. Their heads were covered with small pieces of cloth. At least two birds died while being transported in the train. A team of Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials arrested the man identified as Sheikh Sahid from Jogbani Express that connects Jogbani, a town in Bihar located along the Indo-Nepal border, with Kolkata.
