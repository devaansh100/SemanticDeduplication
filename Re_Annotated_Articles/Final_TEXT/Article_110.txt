Tiger body parts seized in Rajura range
Chandrapur: Foresters of Rajura stumbled upon an old case of tiger poaching after recovery of canines, a nail and whiskers of the big cat from Nalfadi village. Sources in the department claimed that a person has been arrested in the case, while team has been dispatched in the lookout for others involved in the poaching. Sources informed that RFO, Rajura, Videshkumar Galgat got a tip-off about tiger parts being hidden at a place in Nalfadi. Accordingly, raid was conducted and a tiger nail, two canines and a dozen whiskers were recovered hidden underneath a stone in the front yard of a house on Friday. Investigation, however, revealed that the informer himself had planted the tiger nail, whiskers and canines to implicate others. The suspect was later arrested in the evening and his interrogation revealed that he had received the tiger valuables from a person from neighbouring Telangana state. Sources told that a team has been dispatched to undisclosed location in Telangana after the tiger parts supplier. Officials suspect that the tiger in the case is likely to have been poached couple of years back. However, the location of poaching is yet to be ascertained. The arrest of main accused in the case from Telangana could help in resolving the poaching mystery.  Facebook Twitter Linkedin EMail
