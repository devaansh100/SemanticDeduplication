The poacher was found trapping a Kharsa (local hog deer) at the park in Bishnupur district, today. Police apprehended the poacher along with the trapped hog deer. The hunter was identified as Heisnam Kengba. The animal was being kept at Keibul police station. Kharsa is another rare species found at Keibul Lamjao, the only floating national park in the world, and the only home of Sangai. Every year Manipur government has been organising Manipur Sangai festival from November 21 to 30 since 2010. This year Keibul Lamjao became another main location of the Sangai festival, in addition to its centre stage at Hapta Kangjeibung, Imphal. A three-day census carried out by the wildlife wing of the state forest department in March-April last year with the support of the Wildlife Institute of India, Manipur University, non-government organisations, wildlife activists and local clubs. The survey found the park home to 276 hog deer. Manipur Minister for Forest and Environment Th. Shyamkumar during the July budget session put that methods and measures such as electric or solar fencing would be constructed at Keibul Lamjao to defend from illegal poachers. In May this year police arrested one poacher who killed three Kharsa. He was found sneaking into the park using a boat.
