Source of the tortoises will be known only after the arrest of 4th suspect Reptiles will bring prosperity, cops told BENGALURU: A city police team allegedly secretly held onto two tortoises, including an endangered variety, they had seized from poachers believing they would bring them good luck.Byadarahalli police seized the tortoises from three men trying to sell a green aventurine stone weighing 1kg on Magadi Road on August 22 touting it had healing powers and would bring prosperity. A fourth suspect is at large.The quartet also had an endangered Indian star tortoise and an Indian Black Turtle also known as Pond Terrapin. However, police showed only the stone among the seized material.“The tortoises were not shown as part of the seizure as suspects convinced the policemen that the two reptiles would bring them enormous prosperity if they were kept and worshipped on the station premises,” sources said.The cops bought the story from the suspects, who were allegedly involved in carrying out pujas with tortoises and stones after convincing affluent persons that the ceremonies, called the ‘Baarish’, would ensure them riches.Byadarahalli police personnel were tightlipped about the reptiles. They insisted that only a green aventurine stone, a report authenticating it and an autorickshaw had been seized after four male suspects were apprehended.The reptiles were kept in a cement tank on the station premises. “Some activists said the two tortoises’ lives could be at risk. They tried explaining to the cops who were not ready to listen,” said the source. When contacted, a senior police officer confirmed the tortoises were in the station and the forest department had been alerted about it. Police will hand them over soon.
