The trio were handed over to the forest officials on Monday morning.Peafowls are protected under Schedule – I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Poaching them is a non-bailable offence.Pudukottai district forest officer M Anand Kumar said they had secured one more person who had supplied raw materials to the trio to make ammunition for poaching.“Unlike these habitual offenders, people living close to the forest areas indulge in poaching without knowing that such acts can put them behind bars. We have been sensitizing them to keep away from such activities,” said Anand.A case has been booked under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act against the three.
