Exotic birds seized along India-Bangladesh border
Kolkata: A pair of birds, probably seen only on television by most people from this part of the world, were seized by personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) along the India-Bangladesh border on Thursday. Known as Toucans, these birds from South America were being smuggled to Bangladesh from close to the Angrail BOP in North 24 Parganas. The exotic birds sell for as much as Rs 14.2 lakh a pair.“Based on a specific intelligence input, troops of the 158Bn posted at the Angrail BOP carried out a search operation in a forested area near the Halderpara village. Around 6.45 am, the BSF personnel noticed two persons hiding behind a bamboo grove. On being challenged by the troops, the duo escaped through the forest after dropping a cage. A search led to the recovery of the two Keel-Billed Toucans,” a senior BSF official said.Over the years, West Bengal has emerged as a centre for cross-border wildlife trafficking. In June, 2019, a lion cub, apparently smuggled in from Bangladesh, was seized near Kolkata. Birds are regularly smuggled across the border, authorities said, but there are no records of Toucans being seized. The Keel-Billed Toucans or Sulphur-breasted Toucans are found in tropical forests between southern Mexico and Colombia. These birds are the national birds of Belize.“The seized Toucans have been handed over to the Zoological Garden in Alipore. Efforts are on to trace those involved in the racket. Such exotic species are probably smuggled into the country for collectors who keep such animals secretly,” the official added.
