Two caught with tiger skin, nails at Indo-Nepal border in Kheri district
Bareilly: Officials of SSB 3rd battalion and the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in a joint operation have seized a tiger’s skin and other body parts from the possession of two local youths, who were trying to enter Nepal through Belaparsuva border outpost in Lakhimpur Kheri district on Saturday night. Forest department officials said they were interrogating the accused and trying to gather information about other people associated with them in tiger poaching. The accused were identified as Somdev Pasi (23) and Vinod Pasi (22), both hailing from Takiya Purva village adjacent to buffer forests of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. Officials said they seized a tiger skin of 187-cm length, ten front nails and eight back nails from the possession of the accused. The tiger skin was intact, which suggested that the accused might have killed the tiger either by poisoning or snaring, said officials. Notably, a tiger was killed by snaring last year while another tiger got injured after it managed to escape from a snare two months ago, they said. Deputy director DTR (core) Manoj Sonkar told TOI, “We will identify the tiger by matching the stripes with our database using Mstripes software. We are interrogating the accused and trying to get information about the area where the tiger was poached and other people involved in the crime.”  Facebook Twitter Linkedin EMail
