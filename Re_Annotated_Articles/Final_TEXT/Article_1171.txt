Poaching rose in last 2 months, says report
Vijayawada: There has been a substantial rise in instances of poaching in the last two months despite the lockdown, according to a recent report by Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network. In Andhra Pradesh, at least 12 instances of poaching have been reported.Speaking to TOI, principal chief conservator of forests N Pradeep Kumar acknowledged there has been an increase in small-time poachers during the lockdown. “One such case was reported in Anantapur, where locals killed animals for consumption. We don’t have sufficient regular staff but we have 2,592 people, including tribal and fire watchers and several other campers, working with us on an outsourced basis who do an efficient job in curtailing poaching,” Kumar told TOI.Forest officials pointed out that poaching in the state is more for local trade rather than consumption. However, instances of sport hunting have been reported this year. On May 24, forest officials caught two persons for killing a spotted deer at Ummadidevarapalli village in Krishna district. Prior to that, officials caught another 20 persons for hunting Indian bisons for consumption on the state borders in Papikonda National Park.In terms of illegal wildlife trade, scales of pangolins, locally known as ‘alugu’, are popular in both Telugu states. Recently, forest officials rescued a pangolin from a gang of poachers in Edlapadu forest in Guntur and arrested two persons. The alleged poachers had posted a picture of the pangolin on the internet after they learnt that the scales were in huge demand in China and Thailand.Forest officials point out that some of the local villagers are venturing into poaching to compensate for the loss of income during the lockdown. “By and large organised hunting and poaching has been deterred in AP. There are some notorious hunters and we have kept a vigil on their movements,” a senior forest official told TOI. Officials have also set up base and satellite camps.
