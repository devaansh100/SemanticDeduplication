Authorities of the Jaldapara National Park have arrested one person in connection with the poaching of a rhino on 4 April in the Chilapata forest range in the Jaldapara National Park, and recovered two riffles, 24 bullets and three silencers used in the poaching.

The park authorities had earlier arrested three persons from Manipur, immediately the day after the poaching happened. Forest workers had found the carcass of the female rhino aged about 15 in the deep forests of the Chilapata Range in the Park on 4 April. The horn of the animal was missing and there were clear bullet marks on the body of the animal. The arrested person is a resident of the Banchukamari area near the Park, it is learnt. The riffles, bullets and silencers were buried under the ground near the spot of the incident in park, sources said. Sources said forest officials had come to know of the arms after interrogating the persons arrested earlier. “We have arrested one more person involved in the rhino poaching on 4 April in the Jaldapara National Park.
